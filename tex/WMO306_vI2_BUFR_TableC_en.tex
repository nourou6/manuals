Notes:

(1) The operations specified by operator descriptors 2 01, 2 02, 2 03, 2 04, 2 07 and 2 08 remain defined until cancelled or until the end of the data subset.

(2) If change scale is used, then it may be necessary for the originator of the message to supply an appropriately rescaled reference value and data width.

(3) Cancellation of the use of the redefined value shall be effected by the inclusion of the appropriate operand with Y set to 0. The value shall then revert to the original Table B value.

(4) Nesting of operator descriptors must guarantee unambiguous interpretation. In particular, operators defined within a set of replicated descriptors must be cancelled or completed within that set, and the 2~07 operator may neither be nested within any of the 2 01, 2 02, and 2 03 operators, nor vice-versa.

(5) Nesting of the operator descriptor 2 04 is defined such that:

\begin{quote}
(a) Each new definition adds to the currently defined associated field. The order of the included associated information shall correspond with the order in which the associated fields have been defined.

(b) Each cancellation (2 04 000) cancels only the most recently defined addition to the associated field.
\end{quote}

(6) When the descriptor 2 04 YYY is to be used, it shall precede the first of the data descriptors to which it applies.

(7) The data description operator 2 04 YYY, other than 2 04 000, shall be followed immediately by the descriptor 0 31 021 to indicate the meaning of the associated field.

(8) In the data stream, the 6 bits described by 0 31 021 shall precede the YYY bits.

\emph{(continued)}

\emph{(BUFR Table C -- continued)}

(9) Once an associated field has been established and given meaning, the meaning may be changed by a re-application of descriptor 0 31 021. The associated field needs not to be cancelled in order to change the meaning. Further, if an associated field is cancelled, and then re-established, it must be given a meaning by a proper application of the 0 31 021 descriptor, as described in Notes 5 to 8, i.e. a previous assignment of meaning does not remain in force when the associated field is cancelled.

(10) Data description operators shall not be applied to Table B, Class 31 entries.

(11) The operation 2 05 permits the inclusion of plain language.

(12) The operator 2 06 YYY allows for the inclusion of local descriptors in a message, with their associated data, which can then be by-passed by a receiver of the message. It can be applied to element descriptors (F = 0) only.

(13) If "replaced/retained" values are indicated, this shall imply that the data element in the original part of the message has been replaced with a (presumably) better value; the original value has been retained in the message following the replaced/retained operator. If multiple replacements for the same data element are to be included, they shall be ordered such that the original datum shall be last, the first replacement shall precede it, the next precede that, etc. Each (set of) replaced/retained data values shall be indicated by the inclusion of the 2 32 000 operator.

(14) If "substituted values'' are indicated, this shall imply that the data element in the original part of the message is thought to be of poor quality. However, it has been left in the original message as received; an improved value has been placed within the message following the substituted values operator. If multiple substitutions for the same data element are to be included, they shall be ordered such that the first substitution shall be first, the next substitution shall follow it, the next follow that, etc. Thus, the (presumed) ``best'' value will be found at the end of the collection of substituted values. Each (set of) substituted data values shall be indicated by the inclusion of the 2 23 000 operator.

(15) Operator 2 21 YYY allows for the construction of a BUFR message containing only coordinate (Classes 01--09), delayed replication (Class 31) and quality control information. The message could be linked back to the original data-containing message by comparison of the coordinate information in the two messages, or, in a local context, through ``database'' information in Section 2.

(16) First-order statistics have values with a similar range and the same dimensions as the corresponding reported values (e.g. maxima, minima, means).

(17) Difference statistics are difference values; they have dimensions the same as the corresponding reported values with respect to units, but assume a range centred on zero (e.g. the difference between reported and analysed values, the difference between reported and forecast values).

(18) No operator descriptors are reserved for local use.

(19) An event, as defined for use with operators 2 41 000 and 2 42 000, is a set of one or more circumstances described using appropriate Table B descriptors along with their corresponding data values. The grouping of such descriptors together as a single ``event'' allows them to be collectively assigned as the target of a separate descriptor such as 0 33 045 or 0 33 046. When defining a circumstance within an event, descriptor 0 33 042 may be employed preceding the appropriate Table B descriptor in order to indicate that the corresponding value is actually a bound for a range of values.

(20) A categorical forecast value represents a ``best guess'' from among a set of related, and often mutually exclusive, data values or categories. Operator 2 43 000 may be used to designate one or more values as categorical forecast values, and descriptor 0 33 042 may be employed preceding any such value in order to indicate that that value is actually a bound for a range of values.
