33 Numbering order of diamonds (flags – see Flag table 3.9)

34 Scanning mode for one diamond (flags – see Flag table 3.10)

35–38 nt – total number of grid points

Notes:

{empty}(1) For more details, see Part B, GRIB Attachment I.

{empty}(2) The origin of the grid is an icosahedron with 20 triangles and 12 vertices. The triangles are combined to nd quadrangles, the so-called diamonds (e.g. if nd = 10, two of the icosahedron triangles form a diamond, and if nd = 5, 4 icosahedron triangles form a diamond). There are two resolution values called n2 and n3 describing the division of each triangle side. Each triangle side is divided into ni equal parts, where ni = 3^n3^ x 2^n2^ with n3 either equal to 0 or to 1. In the example in GRIB Attachment I, the numbering order of the rectangles is anti-clockwise with a view from the pole point on both hemispheres. Diamonds 1 to 5 are northern hemisphere and diamonds 6 to 10 are southern hemisphere.

{empty}(3) The exponent of 3 for the number of divisions of triangle sides is used only with a value of either 0 or 1.

{empty}(4) The total number of grid points for one global field depends on the grid point position. If e.g. the grid points are located at the vertices of the triangles, then nt = (ni + 1) x (ni + 1) x nd since grid points at diamond edges are contained in both adjacent diamonds and for the same reason the pole points are contained in each of the five adjacent diamonds.

Note: The number given refers to a specific grid required for formulating differential operators. The grid may consist of a centre and an arbitrary surrounding polygon. As model variables may be defined on vertices of the polygons or in the middle of a polygon edge, this generates some different grid descriptions, because each of those is defining their own centre and surrounding polygon. Each of these dependent grids needs their own set of centre longitude/latitude and the longitude/latitude of the boundary polygon vertices. The following picture shows a triangle as base, a hexagon around the triangle's vertices and a quadrilateral around the edge midpoints.

Notes:

{empty}(1) NUT is the number of used different spatial tiles, defining the cover structure of a point. As each of these tiles has one or more different tile attributes A(NAT(ITN)), (ITN=1,…,NUT), for example, (unmodified, snow-covered,…), there are NT= image:../adoc/extracted-media/media/image2.png[image]image:../adoc/extracted-media/media/image2.png[image] fields (that is, the total number of tile/attribute pairs, defined in octet 13) with indices (ITN, IAN) with the following meaning (IAN = \{1,…, NAT(ITN)}):

1,1 First tile – first attribute (e.g. unmodified)

…. …. +
1,NAT(1) First tile – NAT of first tile (last, e.g. snow-covered) attribute

2,1 Second tile – first attribute (e.g. unmodified)

…. …. +

. . +
. .

NUT,1 NUT tile – first attribute (e.g. unmodified)

…. .... +
NUT,NAT(NUT) NUT tile – NAT of last tile (last) attribute

A single tile/attribute index (ITN, IAN) with spatial tile index ITN (1,…,NUT) and attribute A(IAN) with IAN = (1,…,NAT(ITN)) is represented in the template. All NT partitions are linked by the normalization formula, which states that the sum of all partitions must be equal to a normalization term (N = 1 for fractions and N = 100 for percentage) on each point of the grid.

The fields "tile class" and "tile fraction" must be provided in order to obtain the tile structure of each grid point. Note that the field “tile fraction” is time-dependent in the case of defined attributes, whereas the field “tile class” is not affected by attributes (NT = NUT).

31 First dimension coordinate value definition (Code table 5.2)

32 NC1 – number of coefficients or values used to specify first dimension coordinate function

33 Second dimension coordinate value definition (Code table 5.2)

34 NC2 – number of coefficients or values used to specify second dimension coordinate function

36 Second dimension physical significance (Code table 5.3)

37–(36+NC1x4) Coefficients to define first dimension coordinate values in functional form, +
or the explicit coordinate values (IEEE 32-bit floating-point value)

(37+NC1x4)–(36+4(NC1+NC2)) Coefficients to define second dimension coordinate values in functional +
form, or the explicit coordinate values (IEEE 32-bit floating-point value)

Notes:

{empty}(1) This form of representation enables a matrix of values to be depicted at each grid point; the two dimensions of the matrix may represent coordinates expressed in terms of two elemental parameters (e.g. direction and frequency for wave spectra). The numeric values of these coordinates, beyond that of simple subscripts, can be given in a functional form, or as a collection of explicit numbers.

{empty}(2) Some simple coordinate functional forms are tabulated in Code table 5.2. Where a more complex coordinate function applies, the coordinate values shall be explicitly denoted by the inclusion of the actual set of values rather than the coefficients. This shall be indicated by a code figure 0 from Code table 5.2; the number of explicit values coded shall be equal to the appropriate dimension of the matrix for which values are presented and they shall follow octet 36 in place of the coefficients.

{empty}(3) Matrix bit maps will be present only if indicated by octet 22. If present, there shall be one bit map for each grid point with data values, as defined by the primary bit map in Section 6, each of length (NR x NC) bits: a bit set to 1 will indicate a data element at the corresponding location within the matrix. Bit maps shall be represented end-to-end, without regard for octet boundaries; the last bit map shall, if necessary, be followed by bits set to zero to fill any partially used octet.

{empty}(4) Matrices restricted to scanning in the +i direction (left to right) and in the –j direction (top to bottom).

*_Data representation template 5.2 – Grid point data – complex packing_*

Note: For most templates, details of the packing process are described in Regulation 92.9.4.

Octet No. Contents

12–21 Same as data representation template 5.0

22 Group splitting method used (see Code table 5.4)

23 Missing value management used (see Code table 5.5)

24–27 Primary missing value substitute

28–31 Secondary missing value substitute

32–35 NG – number of groups of data values into which field is split

36 Reference for group widths (see Note 12)

37 Number of bits used for the group widths (after the reference value in octet 36 has been +
removed)

38–41 Reference for group lengths (see Note 13)

42 Length increment for the group lengths (see Note 14)

43–46 True length of last group

47 Number of bits used for the scaled group lengths (after subtraction of the reference value +
given in octets 38–41 and division by the length increment given in octet 42)

Notes:

{empty}(1) Group lengths have no meaning for row by row packing, where groups are coordinate lines (so the grid description section and possibly the bit-map section are enough); for consistency, associated field width and reference should then be encoded as 0.

{empty}(2) For row by row packing with a bit-map, there should always be as many groups as rows. In case of rows with only missing values, all associated descriptors should be coded as zero.

{empty}(3) Management of widths into a reference and increments, together with management of lengths as scaled incremental values, are intended to save descriptor size (which is an issue as far as compression gains are concerned).

{empty}(4) Management of explicitly missing values is an alternative to bit-map use within Section 6; it is intended to reduce the whole GRIB message size.

{empty}(5) There may be two types of missing value(s), such as to make a distinction between static misses (for instance, due to a land/sea mask) and occasional misses.

{empty}(6) As an extra option, substitute value(s) for missing data may be specified. If not wished (or not applicable), all bits should be set to 1 for relevant substitute value(s).

{empty}(7) If substitute value(s) are specified, type of content should be consistent with original field values (floating-point - and then IEEE 32-bit encoded-, or integer).

{empty}(8) If primary missing values are used, such values are encoded within appropriate group with all bits set to 1 at packed data level.

{empty}(9) If secondary missing values are used, such values are encoded within appropriate group with all bits set to 1, except the last one set to 0, at packed data level.

{empty}(10) A group containing only missing values (of either type) will be encoded as a constant group (null width, no associated data) and the group reference will have all bits set to 1 for primary type, and all bits set to 1, except the last bit set to 0, for secondary type.

{empty}(11) If necessary, group widths and/or field width of group references may be enlarged to avoid ambiguities between missing value indicator(s) and true data.

{empty}(12) The group width is the number of bits used for every value in a group.

{empty}(13) The group length (L) is the number of values in a group.

{empty}(14) The essence of the complex packing method is to subdivide a field of values into NG groups, where the values in each group have similar sizes. In this procedure, it is necessary to retain enough information to recover the group lengths upon decoding. The NG group lengths for any given field can be described by Ln = ref + Kn x len_inc, n = 1, NG, where ref is given by octets 38–41 and len_inc by octet 42. The NG values of K (the scaled group lengths) are stored in the data section, each with the number of bits specified by octet 47. Since the last group is a special case which may not be able to be specified by this relationship, the length of the last group is stored in octets 43–46.

{empty}(15) See data template 7.2 and associated Notes for complementary information.

*_Data representation template 5.3 – Grid point data – complex packing and spatial differencing_*

Note: For most templates, details of the packing process are described in Regulation 92.9.4.

Octet No. Contents

12–47 Same as data representation template 5.2

48 Order of spatial differencing (see Code table 5.6)

49 Number of octets required in the data section to specify extra descriptors needed for spatial +
differencing (octets 6–ww in data template 7.3)

Notes:

{empty}(1) Spatial differencing is a pre-processing before group splitting at encoding time. It is intended to reduce the size of sufficiently smooth fields, when combined with a splitting scheme as described in data representation template 5.2. At order 1, an initial field of values f is replaced by a new field of values g, where g~1~ = f~1~, g~2~ = f~2~ – f~1~, …, g~n~ = f~n~ – f~n–1~. At order 2, the field of values g is itself replaced by a new field of values h, where h~1~ = f~1~, h~2~ = f~2~, h~3~ = g~3~ – g~2~, …, h~n~ = g~n~ – g~n–1~. To keep values positive, the overall minimum of the resulting field (either g~min~ or h~min~) is removed. At decoding time, after bit string unpacking, the original scaled values are recovered by adding the overall minimum and summing up recursively.

{empty}(2) For differencing of order n, the first n values in the array that are not missing are set to zero in the packed array. These dummy values are not used in unpacking.

{empty}(3) See data template 7.3 and associated Notes for complementary information.

*_Data representation template 5.4 – Grid point data – IEEE floating point data_*

Octet No. Contents

12 Precision (see Code table 5.7)

*_Data representation template 5.40 – Grid point data – JPEG 2000 code stream format_*

Note: For most templates, details of the packing process are described in Regulation 92.9.4.

Octet No. Contents

12–15 Reference value (R) (IEEE 32-bit floating-point value)

16–17 Binary scale factor (E)

18–19 Decimal scale factor (D)

20 Number of bits required to hold the resulting scaled and referenced data values (i.e. depth +
of the greyscale image) (see Note 2)

21 Type of original field values (see Code table 5.1)

22 Type of compression used (see Code table 5.40)

23 Target compression ratio, M:1 (with respect to the bit-depth specified in octet 20), when +
octet 22 indicates lossy compression. Otherwise, set to missing (see Note 3)

Notes:

{empty}(1) The purpose of this template is to scale the grid point data to obtain the desired precision, if appropriate, and then subtract out the reference value from the scaled field as is done using data representation template 5.0. After this, the resulting grid point field can be treated as a greyscale image and is then encoded into the JPEG 2000 code stream format. To unpack the data field, the JPEG 2000 code stream is decoded back into an image, and the original field is obtained from the image data as described in Regulation 92.9.4, Note 4.

{empty}(2) The JPEG 2000 standard specifies that the bit-depth must be in the range of 1 to 38 bits.

{empty}(3) The compression ratio M:1 (e.g. 20:1) specifies that the encoded stream should be less than ((1/M) x depth x number of data points) bits, where depth is specified in octet 20 and the number of data points in octets 6–9 of the data representation section.

_(continued)_

_ +
(Data representation template 5.40 – continued)_

{empty}(4) The order of the data points should remain as specified in the scanning mode flags (Flag table 3.4) set in the appropriate grid definition template, even though the JPEG 2000 standard specifies that an image is stored starting at the top left corner. Assuming that the encoding software is expecting the image data in raster order (left to right across rows for each row), users should set the image width to Ni (or Nx) and the height to Nj (or Ny) if bit 3 of the scanning mode flag equals 0 (adjacent points in i (x) order), when encoding the "image". If bit 3 of the scanning mode flags equals 1 (adjacent points in j (y) order), it may be advantageous to set the image width to Nj (or Ny) and the height to Ni (or Nx).

{empty}(5) This template should not be used when the data points are not available on a rectangular grid, such as occurs if some data points are bit-mapped out or if section 3 describes a quasi-regular grid. If it is necessary to use this template on such a grid, the data field can be treated as a one-dimensional image where the height is set to 1 and the width is set to the total number of data points specified in octets 6–9.

{empty}(6) Negative values of E or D shall be represented according to Regulation 92.1.5.

{empty}(7) JPEG 2000 should not be used for bit-mapped or quasi-regular grid data.

*_Data representation template 5.41 – Grid point data – Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format_*

Note: For most templates, details of the packing process are described in Regulation 92.9.4.

Octet No. Contents

12–15 Reference value (R) (IEEE 32-bit floating-point value)

16–17 Binary scale factor (E)

18–19 Decimal scale factor (D)

20 Number of bits required to hold the resulting scaled and referenced data values (i.e. depth +
of the image) (see Note 2)

21 Type of original field values (see Code table 5.1)

Notes:

{empty}(1) The purpose of this template is to scale the grid point data to obtain the desired precision, if appropriate, and then +
subtract out the reference value from the scaled field, as is done using data representation template 5.0. After this, the resulting grid point field can be treated as an image and is then encoded into PNG format. To unpack the data field, the PNG stream is decoded back into an image, and the original field is obtained from the image data as described in Regulation 92.9.4, Note 4.

{empty}(2) PNG does not support all bit-depths in an image, so it is necessary to define which depths can be used and how they are to be treated. For greyscale images, PNG supports depths of 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 bits. Red-Green-Blue (RGB) colour images can have depths of 8 or 16 bits with an optional alpha sample. Valid values for octet 20 can be:

1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 : Treat as greyscale image

24 : Treat as RGB colour image (each component having 8-bit depth)

32 : Treat as RGB w/ alpha sample colour image (each component having 8-bit depth)

{empty}(3) The order of the data points should remain as specified in the scanning mode flags (Flag table 3.4) set in the appropriate grid definition template, even though the PNG standard specifies that an image is stored starting at the top left corner and scans each row from left to right, starting with the top row. Users should set the image width to Ni (or Nx) and the height to Nj (or Ny) if bit 3 of the scanning mode flag equals 0 (adjacent points in i (x) order), when encoding the "image". If bit 3 of the scanning mode flags equals 1 (adjacent points in j (y) order), it may be advantageous to set the image width to Nj (or Ny) and the height to Ni (or Nx).

{empty}(4) This template should not be used when the data points are not available on a rectangular grid, such as occurs if some data points are bit-mapped out or if section 3 describes a quasi-regular grid. If it is necessary to use this template on such a grid, the data field can be treated as a one-dimensional image where the height is set to 1 and the width is set to the total number of data points specified in octets 6–9.

{empty}(5) Negative values of E or D shall be represented according to Regulation 92.1.5.

*_Data representation template 5.42 – Grid point and spectral data – CCSDS recommended lossless +
compression_*

Preliminary note: For most templates, details of the packing process are described in regulation 92.9.4.

This template is only valid for the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems Recommendation for Space Data System Standards__, Lossless Data Compression,__ CCSDS 121.0-B-2, Blue Book, May 2012.

Octet No. Contents

12–15 Reference value (R) (IEEE 32-bit floating-point value)

16–17 Binary scale factor (E)

18–19 Decimal scale factor (D)

20 Number of bits required to hold the resulting scaled and referenced data values (see Note 1)

21 Type of original field values (see Code table 5.1)

22 CCSDS compression options mask (see Note 3)

23 Block size

24–25 Reference sample interval

Notes:

{empty}(1) The intent of this template is to scale the grid point data to obtain the desired precision, if appropriate, and then subtract the reference value from the scaled field, as is done using data representation template 5.0. After this, the resulting grid point field can be treated as a greyscale image and encoded into the CCSDS recommended standard for lossless data compression code stream format. To unpack the data field, the CCSDS recommended standard for lossless data compression code stream is decoded back into an image, and the original field is obtained from the image data as described in regulation 92.9.4, Note 4.

{empty}(2) The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) recommended standard for lossless data compression is the standard used by space agencies for the compression of scientific data transmitted from satellites and other space instruments. CCSDS recommended standard for lossless data compression is a very fast predictive compression algorithm based on the extended-Rice algorithm. It uses Golomb–Rice codes for entropy coding. The sequence of prediction errors is divided into blocks. Each block is compressed using a two-pass algorithm. In the first pass, the best coding method for the whole block is determined. In the second pass, the output of the marker of the selected coding method is encoded as ancillary information along with prediction errors.

The coding methods include:

* {blank}
+
____
Golomb–Rice codes of a chosen rank
____
* {blank}
+
____
Unary code for transformed pairs of prediction errors
____
* {blank}

(Product definition template 5.50 – continued)_

Notes:

{empty}(1) Removal of the real part of (0.0) coefficient from packed data is intended to reduce the variability of the coefficients, in order to improve packing accuracy.

{empty}(2) For some spectral representations, the (0.0) coefficient represents the mean value of the parameter represented.

{empty}(3) Negative values of E or D shall be represented according to Regulation 92.1.5.

*_Data representation template 5.51 – Spherical harmonics data – complex packing_*

Note: For most templates, details of the packing process are described in Regulation 92.9.4.

Octet No. Contents

12–20 Same as data representation template 5.50

21–24 P – Laplacian scaling factor (expressed in 10^–6^ units)

25–26 J~S~ – pentagonal resolution parameter of the unpacked subset (see Note 1)

27–28 K~S~ – pentagonal resolution parameter of the unpacked subset (see Note 1)

29–30 M~S~ – pentagonal resolution parameter of the unpacked subset (see Note 1)

31–34 T~S~ – total number of values in the unpacked subset (see Note 1)

35 Precision of the unpacked subset (see Code table 5.7)

Notes:

{empty}(1) The unpacked subset is a set of values defined in the same way as the full set of values (on a spectrum limited to J~S~, K~S~ and M~S~), but on which scaling and packing are not applied. Associated values are stored in octets 6 onwards +
of Section 7.

{empty}(2) The remaining coefficients are multiplied by (n x (n+1))^P^, scaled and packed. The operator associated with this multiplication is derived from the Laplacian operator on the sphere.

{empty}(3) The retrieval formula for a coefficient of wave number n is then:

Y = (R + X x 2^E^) x10^–D^ x (n x (n+1))^–P^ where X is the packed scaled value associated with the coefficient.

*_Data representation template 5.61 – Grid point data – simple packing with logarithm pre-processing_*

Preliminary note: This template is experimental, was not validated at the time of publication and should be used only for bilateral previously agreed tests.

Octet No. Contents

12–15 Reference value (R) (IEEE 32-bit floating-point value)

16–17 Binary scale factor (E)

18–19 Decimal scale factor (D)

20 Number of bits used for each packed value

21–24 Pre-processing parameter (B) (IEEE 32-bit floating-point value)

Notes:

{empty}(1) This template is appropriately designed for data sets with all non-negative values and a wide variability range (more then 5 orders of magnitude). It must not be used for data sets with negative values or smaller variability range.

{empty}(2) A logarithm pre-processing algorithm is used to fit the variability range into one or two order of magnitudes before using the simple packing algorithm. It requires a parameter (B) to assure that all values passed to the logarithm function are positive. Thus scaled values are Z = ln (Y+B), where Y are the original values, ln is the natural logarithm (or Napierian) function and B is chosen so that Y+B > 0.

{empty}(3) Best practice follows for choosing the B pre-processing parameter.

____
{empty}(a) If the data set minimum value is positive, B can be safely put to zero.

{empty}(b) If the data set minimum is zero, all values must be scaled to become greater than zero and B can be equal to the minimum positive value in the data set.
____

{empty}(4) Data shall be packed using data template 7.

the number of bits specified in octet 20 of data representation template 5.0. Bits set to zero +
shall be appended as necessary to ensure this sequence of numbers ends on an octet +
boundary

of data representation template 5.2. Bits set to zero shall be appended as necessary to +
ensure this sequence of numbers ends on an octet boundary

representation template 5.2)

[zz+1]–nn Packed values (X2 in the decoding formula), where each value is a deviation from its respec- +
tive group reference value

Notes:

{empty}(1) Group descriptors mentioned above may not be physically present; if associated field width is 0.

{empty}(2) Group lengths have no meaning for row by row packing; for consistency, associated field width should then be encoded as 0. So no specific test for row by row case is mandatory at decoding software level to handle encoding/decoding of group descriptors.

{empty}(3) Scaled group lengths, if present, are encoded for each group. But the true last group length (unscaled) should be taken from data representation template.

{empty}(4) For groups with a constant value, associated field width is 0, and no incremental data are physically present.

ber of bits specified in octet 20 of data representation template 5.0. Bits set to zero shall be +
appended where necessary to ensure this sequence of numbers ends on an octet boundary

[xx+1]–nn Same as for data representation template 7.2

Notes:

{empty}(1) Referring to the notation in Note 1 of data representation template 5.3, at order 1, the values stored in octets 6–ww are g~1~ and g~min~. At order 2, the values stored are h~1~, h~2~, and h~min~.

{empty}(2) Extra descriptors related to spatial differencing are added before the splitting descriptors, to reflect the separation between the two approaches. It enables to share software parts between cases with and without spatial differencing.

{empty}(3) The position of overall minimum after initial data values is a choice that enables less software management.

{empty}(4) Overall minimum will be negative in most cases. First bit should indicate the sign: 0 if positive, 1 if negative.
