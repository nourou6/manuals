Note: To satisfy these criteria, the following method of successive approximations is recommended, but other methods of attaining equivalent results may suit some national practices better and may be used:

{empty}(i) The lowest level for which wind data are available and the aircraft reference level constitute the first and the last significant levels. The deviation from the linearly interpolated values between these two levels is then considered. If no direction deviates by more than 10 degrees true and no speed by more than five metres per second, no other significant level need be reported. Whenever one parameter deviates by more than the limit specified in paragraph (b) above the level of greatest deviation becomes a supplementary significant level for both parameters;

{empty}(ii) The additional significant levels so introduced divide the sounding into two layers. In each separate layer, the deviation from the linearly interpolated values between the base and the top are then considered. The process used in paragraph (i) above is repeated and yields other significant levels. These additional levels in turn modify the layer distribution, and the method is applied again until any level is approximated to the above-mentioned specified values.

*B/C26.6.8 Beginning and end of missing temperature data*

*B/C26.6.8.1* A layer for which temperature data are missing shall be indicated by reporting the boundary levels of the layer, provided that the layer is at least 20 hPa thick. The boundary levels are the levels closest to the bottom (beginning of the missing data) and the top (end of the missing data) of the layer for which temperature data are available. The boundary levels are not required to meet “significant temperature level” criteria. [35.3.1.6]

The boundary levels are the levels closest to the bottom (beginning of the missing data) and the top (end of the missing data) of the layer for which the observed data are available. The boundary levels are not required to meet “significant wind level” criteria. [35.3.2.2]
