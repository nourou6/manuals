*CODE TABLES AND FLAG TABLES ASSOCIATED WITH BUFR/CREX TABLE B*

Note: In developing code tables associated with BUFR/CREX Table B to specify units of elements, the following principles should be applied:

{empty}(a) Code tables specifying the units for an element which is defined, in the _Manual on Codes_, by a single symbolic letter shall be compatible with the relevant existing WMO code tables;

{empty}(b) Code tables combining two or more existing WMO code tables to specify the units for an element which is defined, in the _Manual on Codes_, by a group of symbolic letters shall be compatible with the combined code figures of the relevant group of symbolic letters;

{empty}(c) Code tables combining two or more existing WMO code tables to specify the units for an element which is defined, in the _Manual on Codes_, by different symbolic letters shall be compatible with the code figures of the relevant symbolic letters, with successive tens or hundreds values added, as appropriate;

{empty}(d) Code tables and flag tables should only be used for reporting qualitative information. Quantitative information should be reported as observed using entries in Table B. “Data description operators” from Table C should be applied when a “scale change” or “data width change” is required;

{empty}(e) Reference to existing specification(s) and code table(s) in the _Manual on Codes_, with explanation of possible deviations, shall be given in an additional table annexed to the code tables associated with BUFR/CREX Table B.

Note:

____
{empty}(1) Freezing level is the level at which temperature first decreases to 0 °C. The criteria for the selection of freezing level in upper-air observations are:

{empty}(a) If the surface temperature is not lower than 0 °C when the radiosonde is released, then the lowest level at which the temperature first decreases to 0 °C will be selected as the freezing level.

{empty}(b) If the surface temperature is equal to 0 °C, then the surface level will be the freezing level.

{empty}(c) If during observation there is no level at which the temperature equals 0 °C, then the closest two levels between which the temperature crosses from a positive to a negative value should be used to interpolate the freezing-level temperature equal to 0 °C.

{empty}(d) The following elements will be calculated for the freezing level: time, elevation, pressure, humidity, dewpoint temperature, dewpoint depression, and deviation of longitude and latitude.

Notes:

{empty}(1) The middle portion of this code table (code figures 100–199) includes terms on several levels to cover simple and increasingly complex automatic stations.

{empty}(2) Generic terms for weather (e.g. fog, drizzle) are intended for use at automatic stations capable of determining types of weather but no other information. Generic terms are included in the code table using all capital letters.

{empty}(3) Code figures for generic precipitation (code figures 140–148) are arranged in order of increasing complexity. For example, a very simple station that can sense only the presence or absence of precipitation would use code figure 140 (precipitation). At the next level, an automatic station capable of sensing amount but not type would use code figure 141 or 142. An automatic station capable of sensing gross type (liquid, solid, freezing) and amount would use code figures 143–148. An automatic station capable of reporting actual types of precipitation (e.g. drizzle rain), but not the amount, would use the appropriate whole decile number (e.g. 150 for generic drizzle, 160 for generic rain).
