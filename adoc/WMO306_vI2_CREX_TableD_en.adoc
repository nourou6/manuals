Notes:

{empty}(1) From a conceptual point of view, Table D is _not necessary_:

____
{empty}(a) The Data description section can fully and completely describe the data using only element descriptors, operator descriptors and the rules of description;

{empty}(b) Such a means of defining the data would involve considerable overheads in terms of the length of the +
Data description section. Table D is a device to reduce these overheads;

{empty}(c) Each entry within Table D contains a list of descriptors. Each sequence descriptor that references to +
Table D may be “expanded” by replacing it with the list corresponding to that entry. The process of “expansion” is well defined, provided it results in a set of element descriptors and operator descriptors;

{empty}(d) Descriptors listed in entries to Table D may themselves refer to Table D, provided no circularity results on repeated expansion;

{empty}(e) The initial Table D has been limited to lists of descriptors likely to be used frequently. Every attempt has been made not to produce initial tables that are too comprehensive. _Minor differences of reporting practice can be accommodated by not endeavouring to reduce each observation type to a single descriptor._ Indeed, much more flexibility is retained if the Data description section is envisaged as containing three or four descriptors.
____

{empty}(2) It should be noted that, initially, effort has been concentrated on the requirements for observational data. Extensions forecast data, time series data, products, etc., follow logically and can be added at an appropriate future date.

{empty}(4) Underwater soundings are included, with some minor omissions, to illustrate the facility to describe data of slightly different contents.

{empty}(7) Categories 48 to 63 are reserved for local use; all other categories are reserved for future development.

{empty}(8) Entries 192 to 255 within all categories are reserved for local use.

_Editorial note: Notes are numbered so as to be consistent with the BUFR Table D for convenience._

Notes:

{empty}(1) These entries include the facility to update the Table A code figure and data description.

{empty}(2) It is better to use different Class 00 descriptors for the defining and defined elements, in the same way as different descriptors correspond to pressure considered as a coordinate and pressure measured at a given point; otherwise special rules would be needed to interpret such message. Entries B 00 010 to B 00 012 define F, X and Y for Tables B and D; entry B 00 030 is a descriptor used as data and provides the F, X and Y values defining a sequence for Table D entries.

{empty}(3) It could be argued that, as only additions are possible, only complete lines should be allowed; but it is conceivable that local areas will require changes as well as additions, so it is better and in any case clearer to provide descriptions for all the fields.

Note:

{empty}(5) This replication factor shall have a value of “1” when a 2-D feature is being described, whereas 3-D features may be described via any one of the following methods:

____
{empty}(a) Via two or more horizontal sections in successive ascending flight levels. In this case, each section shall be described by an identical number of latitude/longitude points listed in identical order (i.e. where each point x of section n is to be joined via a straight line to point x of section n+1), in order to ensure that the overall shape of the 3-D feature is unambiguously described. In this case, all values reported for B 33 042 shall be “missing”.

{empty}(b) Via a single horizontal section with an appropriate value reported for B 33 042, as follows. In all such cases, the corresponding horizontal section description applies throughout the entire region.

{empty}(i) A value of “0” to indicate a region above (but not including) the reported flight level and with unspecified upper bound.

{empty}(ii) A value of “1” to indicate a region above (and including) the reported flight level and with unspecified upper bound.

{empty}(iii) A value of “2” to indicate a region below (but not including) the reported flight level and extending to the surface.

{empty}(iv) A value of “3” to indicate a region below (and including) the reported flight level and extending to the surface.

{empty}(c) Via two replications of the same horizontal section at the same reported flight level, in order to indicate a region extending both below and above (and including!) the reported flight level. In this case, the values reported for the two replications of B 33 042 shall be as follows:

{empty}(i) Values of “3” and “1”, respectively, to indicate a region beginning from below a reported flight level, but continuing through that level upward to some unspecified point above (e.g. TOP ABV FL100).

{empty}(ii) Values of “1” and “3”, respectively, to indicate a region beginning from above a reported flight level, but continuing through that level downward to some unspecified point below (e.g. CIGS BLW FL010).

Notes:

{empty}(1) For MOD OCNL SEV code as 12 (extreme in clear air) or 13 (extreme in cloud).

{empty}(2) Code table values:

FRQ = code figure 8 (8 oktas)

OCNL EMBD = code figure 6 (6 oktas)

ISOL = code figure 2 (2 oktas) when the cloud = Cb.

{empty}(3) Front direction (towards which the front is moving) must always be given as it is needed for plotting purposes. A front direction with a front speed of zero would indicate a slow front. A value in the code table exists to represent a quasi-stationary front.

{empty}(4) The statistic is to determine whether the following tropopause levels are minimum, maximum or spot values (missing code value).

{empty}(5) Decibel (dB) is a logarithmic measure of the relative power, or of the relative values of two flux densities, especially of sound intensities and radio and radar power densities. In radar meteorology, the logarithmic scale (dBZ) is used for measuring radar reflectivity factor (obtained from the American Meteorological Society _Glossary of Meteorology_).
