INTRODUCTION

Volume I of the _Manual on Codes_ contains WMO international codes for meteorological data and other geophysical data relating to meteorology; it constitutes Annex II to the _Technical Regulations_ (WMO-No. 49) and has therefore the status of a Technical Regulation. It is issued in three volumes: Volume I.1, containing Part A; Volume I.2, containing Part B and Part C; and Volume I.3 containing Part D.

Coded messages are used for the international exchange of meteorological information comprising observational data provided by the World Weather Watch (WWW) Global Observing System and processed data provided by the WWW Global Data-processing and Forecasting System. Coded messages are also used for the international exchange of observed and processed data required in specific applications of meteorology to various human activities and for exchanges of information related to meteorology.

The codes are composed of a set of CODE FORMS and BINARY CODES made up of SYMBOLIC LETTERS (or groups of letters) representing meteorological or, as the case may be, other geophysical elements. In messages, these symbolic letters (or groups of letters) are transcribed into figures indicating the value or the state of the elements described. SPECIFICATIONS have been defined for the various symbolic letters to permit their transcription into figures. In some cases, the specification of the symbolic letter is sufficient to permit a direct transcription into figures. In other cases, it requires the use of CODE FIGURES, the specifications of which are given in CODE TABLES. Furthermore, a certain number of SYMBOLIC WORDS and SYMBOLIC FIGURE GROUPS have been developed for use as code names, code words, symbolic prefixes or indicator groups.

Rules concerning the selection of code forms to be exchanged for international purposes, and the selection of their symbolic words, figure groups and letters, are laid down in the _Technical Regulations_ (WMO-No. 49), Volume I, Part II, section 2 (2015 edition, updated in 2016). These code forms are contained in Volume I of the _Manual on Codes_, issued as Volume I.1 – Part A, Volume I.2 – Part B and Part C, and Volume I.3 – Part D.

Apart from these international codes, several sets of _regional codes_ exist which are intended only for exchanges within a given WMO Region. These codes are contained in Volume II of the _Manual on Codes_, which also contains descriptions of the following:

– Regional coding procedures for the use of international code forms;

– National coding practices in the use of international or regional codes of which the WMO Secretariat has been informed;

– National code forms.

A number of special codes that are used in messages exchanged over the WWW Global Telecommunication System circuits, and which comprise ice and satellite ephemeris codes, are included in Volume II as an appendix.

== VOLUME I.1:

*Part A – Alphanumeric Codes* consists of five sections. The standard coding procedures are distinguished by the use of the term “shall” in the English text, and by suitable equivalent terms in the French, Russian and Spanish texts. Where national practices do not conform with these regulations, Members concerned shall formally notify the Secretary-General of WMO for the benefit of other Members.

== VOLUME I.2:

Note: This volume is designated in its entirety as Technical Specifications.

*Part B – Binary Codes* consists of the list of binary codes with their specifications and associated code tables.

*Part C – Common Features to Binary and Alphanumeric Codes* consists of table-driven alphanumeric codes and of common code tables to binary and alphanumeric codes.

== VOLUME I.3:

Note: This volume is designated in its entirety as Technical Specifications.

*Part D – Representations derived from data models* consists of the specification of the list of standard representations derived from data models, including those using extensible markup language (XML), with their specifications and associated code tables.

This is the first edition of Volume I.3 of the _Manual on Codes_ and introduces the use of XML.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

{empty}1. The _Technical Regulations_ (WMO-No. 49) of the World Meteorological Organization are presented in three volumes:

Volume I – General meteorological standards and recommended practices +
Volume II – Meteorological service for international air navigation +
Volume III – Hydrology

Purpose of the Technical Regulations

{empty}2. The Technical Regulations are determined by the World Meteorological Congress in accordance with Article 8 (d) of the Convention.

{empty}3. These Regulations are designed:

{empty}(a) To facilitate cooperation in meteorology and hydrology among Members;

{empty}(b) To meet, in the most effective manner, specific needs in the various fields of application of meteorology and operational hydrology in the international sphere;

{empty}(c) To ensure adequate uniformity and standardization in the practices and procedures employed in achieving (a) and (b) above.

Types of Regulations

{empty}4. The Technical Regulations comprise _standard_ practices and procedures and _recommended_ practices and procedures.

{empty}5. The definitions of these two types of Regulations are as follows:

The _standard_ practices and procedures:

{empty}(a) Shall be the practices and procedures that Members are required to follow or implement;

{empty}(b) Shall have the status of requirements in a technical resolution in respect of which Article 9 (b) of the Convention is applicable;

{empty}(c) Shall invariably be distinguished by the use of the term _shall_ in the English text, and by suitable equivalent terms in the Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian and Spanish texts.

The _recommended_ practices and procedures:

{empty}(a) Shall be the practices and procedures with which Members are urged to comply;

{empty}(b) Shall have the status of recommendations to Members, to which Article 9 (b) of the Convention shall not be applied;

{empty}(c) Shall be distinguished by the use of the term _should_ in the English text (except where otherwise provided by decision of Congress) and by suitable equivalent terms in the Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian and Spanish texts.

{empty}6. In accordance with the above definitions, Members shall do their utmost to implement the _standard_ practices and procedures. In accordance with Article 9 (b) of the Convention and in conformity with Regulation 128 of the General Regulations, Members shall formally notify the Secretary-General, in writing, of their intention to apply the _standard_ practices and procedures of the Technical Regulations, except those for which they have lodged a specific deviation. Members shall also inform the Secretary-General, at least three months in advance, of any change in the degree of their implementation of a _standard_ practice or procedure as previously notified and the effective date of the change.

{empty}7. Members are urged to comply with _recommended_ practices and procedures, but it is not necessary to notify the Secretary-General of non-observance except with regard to practices and procedures contained in Volume II.

{empty}8. In order to clarify the status of the various Regulations, the _standard_ practices and procedures are distinguished from the _recommended_ practices and procedures by a difference in typographical practice, as indicated in the editorial note.

Status of annexes and appendices

{empty}9. The following annexes to the _Technical Regulations_ (Volumes I to III), also called Manuals, are published separately and contain regulatory material having the status of _standard_ and/or _recommended_ practices and procedures:

I _International Cloud Atlas_ (WMO-No. 407) – Manual on the Observation of Clouds and Other Meteors, sections 1, 2.1.1, 2.1.4, 2.1.5, 2.2.2, 1 to 4 in 2.3.1 to 2.3.10 (for example, 2.3.1.1, 2.3.1.2, etc.), 2.8.2, 2.8.3, 2.8.5, 3.1 and the definitions (in grey-shaded boxes) of 3.2;

II _Manual on Codes_ (WMO-No. 306), Volume I;

III _Manual on the Global Telecommunication System_ (WMO-No. 386);

IV _Manual on the Global Data-processing and Forecasting System_ (WMO-No. 485);

V _Manual on the Global Observing System_ (WMO-No. 544), Volume I;

VI _Manual on Marine Meteorological Services_ (WMO-No. 558), Volume I;

VII _Manual on the WMO Information System_ (WMO-No. 1060);

VIII _Manual on the WMO Integrated Global Observing System_ (WMO-No. 1160).

These annexes (Manuals) are established by decision of Congress and are intended to facilitate the application of Technical Regulations to specific fields. Annexes may contain both _standard_ and _recommended_ practices and procedures.

{empty}10. Texts called appendices, appearing in the _Technical Regulations_ or in an annex to the _Technical Regulations_, have the same status as the Regulations to which they refer.

Status of notes and attachments

{empty}11. Certain notes (preceded by the indication “Note”) are included in the _Technical Regulations_ for explanatory purposes; they may, for instance, refer to relevant WMO Guides and publications. These notes do not have the status of Technical Regulations.

{empty}12. The _Technical Regulations_ may also include attachments, which usually contain detailed guidelines related to _standard_ and _recommended_ practices and procedures. Attachments, however, do not have regulatory status.

Updating of the *_Technical Regulations_* and their annexes (Manuals)

{empty}13. The _Technical Regulations_ are updated, as necessary, in the light of developments in meteorology and hydrology and related techniques, and in the application of meteorology and operational hydrology. Certain principles previously agreed upon by Congress and applied in the selection of material for inclusion in the Technical Regulations are reproduced below. These principles provide guidance for constituent bodies, in particular technical commissions, when dealing with matters pertaining to the Technical Regulations:

{empty}(a) Technical commissions should not recommend that a Regulation be a standard practice unless it is supported by a strong majority;

{empty}(b) Technical Regulations should contain appropriate instructions to Members regarding implementation of the provision in question;

{empty}(c) No major changes should be made to the Technical Regulations without consulting the appropriate technical commissions;

{empty}(d) Any amendments to the Technical Regulations submitted by Members or by constituent bodies should be communicated to all Members at least three months before they are submitted to Congress.

{empty}14. Amendments to the _Technical Regulations_ – as a rule – are approved by Congress.

{empty}15. If a recommendation for an amendment is made by a session of the appropriate technical commission and if the new regulation needs to be implemented before the next session of Congress, the Executive Council may, on behalf of the Organization, approve the amendment in accordance with Article 14 (c) of the Convention. Amendments to annexes to the _Technical Regulations_ proposed by the appropriate technical commissions are normally approved by the Executive Council.

{empty}16. If a recommendation for an amendment is made by the appropriate technical commission and the implementation of the new regulation is urgent, the President of the Organization may, on behalf of the Executive Council, take action as provided by Regulation 9 (5) of the General Regulations.

Note: A simple (fast-track) procedure may be used for amendments to technical specifications in Annexes II (_Manual on Codes_ (WMO-No. 306)), III (_Manual on the Global Telecommunication System_ (WMO-No. 386)), IV (_Manual on the Global Data-processing and Forecasting System_ (WMO-No. 485)), V (_Manual on the Global Observing System_ (WMO-No. 544)), VII (_Manual on the WMO Information System_ (WMO-No. 1060)) and VIII (_Manual on the WMO Integrated Global Observing System_ (WMO-No. 1160)). Application of the simple (fast-track) procedure is defined in the appendix to these General Provisions.

{empty}17. After each session of Congress (every four years), a new edition of the _Technical Regulations_, including the amendments approved by Congress, is issued. With regard to the amendments between sessions of Congress, Volumes I and III of the _Technical Regulations_ are updated, as necessary, upon approval of changes thereto by the Executive Council. The _Technical Regulations_ updated as a result of an approved amendment by the Executive Council are considered a new update of the current edition. The material in Volume II is prepared by the World Meteorological Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization working in close cooperation, in accordance with the Working Arrangements agreed by these Organizations. In order to ensure consistency between Volume II and Annex 3 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation – _Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation_, the issuance of amendments to Volume II is synchronized with the respective amendments to Annex 3 by the International Civil Aviation Organization.

Note: Editions are identified by the year of the respective session of Congress whereas updates are identified by the year of approval by the Executive Council, for example “Updated in 2012”.

WMO Guides

{empty}18. In addition to the _Technical Regulations_, appropriate Guides are published by the Organization. They describe practices, procedures and specifications which Members are invited to follow or implement in establishing and conducting their arrangements for compliance with the Technical Regulations, and in otherwise developing meteorological and hydrological services in their respective countries. The Guides are updated, as necessary, in the light of scientific and technological developments in hydrometeorology, climatology and their applications. The technical commissions are responsible for the selection of material to be included in the Guides. These Guides and their subsequent amendments shall be considered by the Executive Council.

APPENDIX. PROCEDURES FOR AMENDING WMO MANUALS AND GUIDES THAT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMMISSION FOR BASIC SYSTEMS

== 1. DESIGNATION OF RESPONSIBLE COMMITTEES

The Commission for Basic Systems (CBS) shall, for each Manual and Guide, designate one of its Open Programme Area Groups (OPAGs) as being responsible for that Manual and its associated technical guides. The Open Programme Area Group may choose to designate one of its Expert Teams as the designated committee for managing changes to all or part of that Manual; if no Expert Team is designated, the Implementation Coordination Team for the OPAG takes on the role of the designated committee.

== 2. GENERAL VALIDATION AND IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES

=== 2.1 Proposal of amendments

Amendments to a Manual or a Guide managed by CBS shall be proposed in writing to the Secretariat. The proposal shall specify the needs, purposes and requirements and include information on a contact point for technical matters.

=== 2.2 Drafting recommendation

The designated committee for the relevant part of a Manual or a Guide, supported by the Secretariat, shall validate the stated requirement (unless it is consequential to an amendment to the WMO Technical Regulations) and develop a draft recommendation to respond to the requirement, as appropriate.

=== 2.3 Procedures for approval

After a draft recommendation of the designated committee is validated in accordance with the procedure given in section 7 below, depending on the type of amendments, the designated committee should select one of the following procedures for the approval of the amendments:

{empty}(a) Simple (fast-track) procedure (see section 3 below);

{empty}(b) Standard (adoption of amendments between CBS sessions) procedure (see section 4 below);

{empty}(c) Complex (adoption of amendments during CBS sessions) procedure (see section 5 below).

=== 2.4 Date of implementation

The designated committee should define an implementation date in order to give WMO Members sufficient time to implement the amendments after the date of notification. For procedures other than the simple (fast-track) one, if the time between the date of notification and implementation date is less than six months, the designated committee shall document the reasons for its decision.

=== 2.5 Urgent introduction

Regardless of the above procedures, as an exceptional measure, the following procedure accommodates urgent user needs to introduce elements in lists of technical details, or to correct errors:

{empty}(a) A draft recommendation developed by the designated committee shall be validated according to the steps defined in section 7 below;

{empty}(b) The draft recommendation for pre-operational use of a list entry, which can be used in operational data and products, shall be approved by the chairperson of the designated committee and the chairperson of the responsible OPAG, and the president of CBS. A listing of pre-operational list entries is kept online on the WMO web server;

{empty}(c) Pre-operational list entries shall then be submitted for approval by one of the procedures in 2.3 above for operational use;

{empty}(d) Any version numbers associated with the technical implementation should be incremented at the least significant level.

=== 2.6 Issuing updated version

Once amendments to a Manual or a Guide are adopted, an updated version of the relevant part of the Manual shall be issued in the languages agreed for its publication. The Secretariat shall inform all Members of the availability of a new updated version of that part at the date of notification mentioned in 2.4 above. If amendments are not incorporated into the published text of the relevant Manual or Guide at the time of the amendment, there should be a mechanism to publish the amendments at the time of their implementation and to retain a permanent record of the sequence of amendments.

== 3. SIMPLE (FAST-TRACK) PROCEDURE

=== 3.1 Scope

The simple (fast-track) procedure shall be used only for changes to components of the Manual that have been designated and marked as “technical specifications to which the simple (fast-track) procedure for the approval of amendments may be applied”.

Note: An example would be the addition of code list items in the _Manual on Codes_ (WMO-No. 306).

=== 3.2 Endorsement

Draft recommendations developed by the responsible committee, including a date for implementation of the amendments, shall be submitted to the chairperson of the relevant OPAG for endorsement.

=== 3.3 Approval

==== 3.3.1 Minor adjustments

Correcting typographical errors in descriptive text is considered a minor adjustment, and will be done by the Secretariat in consultation with the president of CBS. See Figure 1.

Figure 1. Adoption of amendments to a Manual by minor adjustment

==== 3.3.2 Other types of amendments

For other types of amendments, the English version of the draft recommendation, including a date of implementation, should be distributed to the focal points for matters concerning the relevant Manual for comments, with a deadline of two months for the reply. It should then be submitted to the president of CBS for consultation with presidents of technical commissions affected by the change. If endorsed by the president of CBS, the change should be passed to the President of WMO for consideration and adoption on behalf of the Executive Council (EC).

==== 3.3.3 Frequency 

The implementation of amendments approved through the simple (fast-track) procedure can be twice a year in May and November. See Figure 2.

The implementation of amendments approved through the simple (fast-track) procedure can be twice a year in May and November. See Figure 2.

Figure 2. Adoption of amendments to a Manual be simple (fast-track) procedure.

== 4. STANDARD (ADOPTION OF AMENDMENTS BETWEEN CBS SESSIONS) PROCEDURE

=== 4.1 Scope

The standard (adoption of amendments between CBS sessions) procedure shall be used for changes that have an operational impact on those Members who do not wish to exploit the change, but that have only minor financial impact, or that are required to implement changes in the _Technical Regulations_ (WMO-No. 49), Volume II – Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation.

=== 4.2 Approval of draft recommendations

For the direct adoption of amendments between CBS sessions, the draft recommendation developed by the designated committee, including a date of implementation of the amendments, shall be submitted to the chairperson of the responsible OPAG and president and vice-president of CBS for approval. The president of CBS shall consult with the presidents of technical commissions affected by the change. In the case of recommendations in response to changes in the _Technical Regulations_ (WMO-No. 49), Volume II – Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation, the president of CBS shall consult with the president of the Commission for Aeronautical Meteorology.

=== 4.3 Circulation to Members

Upon approval of the president of CBS, the Secretariat sends the recommendation to all Members, in the languages in which the Manual is published, including a date of implementation of the amendments, for comments to be submitted within two months following the dispatch of the amendments. If the recommendation is sent to Members via electronic mail, there shall be public announcement of the amendment process including dates, for example by WMO Operational Newsletter on the WMO website, to ensure all relevant Members are informed.

=== 4.4 Agreement

Those Members not having replied within the two months following the dispatch of the amendments are implicitly considered as having agreed with the amendments.

=== 4.5 Coordination

Members are invited to designate a focal point responsible to discuss any comments/disagreements with the designated committee. If the discussion between the designated committee and the focal point cannot result in an agreement on a specific amendment by a Member, this amendment will be reconsidered by the designated committee. If a Member cannot agree that the financial or operational impact is minor, the redrafted amendment shall be approved by the complex (adoption of amendments during CBS sessions) procedure described in section 5 below.

=== 4.6 Notification

Once amendments are agreed by Members, and after consultation with the chairperson of the responsible OPAG, the vice-president of CBS and the president of CBS (who should consult with presidents of other commissions affected by the change), the Secretariat notifies at the same time the Members and the members of the Executive Council of the approved amendments and of the date of their implementation. See Figure 3.

Figure 3. Adoption of amendments between CBS sessions

== 5. COMPLEX (ADOPTION OF AMENDMENTS DURING CBS SESSIONS) PROCEDURE

=== 5.1 Scope

The complex (adoption of amendments during CBS sessions) procedure shall be used for changes for which the simple (fast-track) procedure or standard (adoption of amendments between CBS sessions) procedure cannot be applied.

=== 5.2 Procedure

For the adoption of amendments during CBS sessions, the designated committee submits its recommendation, including a date of implementation of the amendments, to the Implementation Coordination Team of the responsible Open Programme Area Group. The recommendation is then passed to the presidents of technical commissions affected by the change for consultation, and to a CBS session that shall be invited to consider comments submitted by presidents of technical commissions. The document for the CBS session shall be distributed not later than 45 days before the opening of the session. Following the CBS session, the recommendation shall then be submitted to a session of the Executive Council for decision. See Figure 4.

== 6. PROCEDURE FOR THE CORRECTION OF EXISTING MANUAL CONTENTS

=== 6.1 Correcting errors in items within Manuals 

Where a minor error in the specification of an item that defines elements within a Manual is found, for example, a typing error or an incomplete definition, the item shall be amended and re-published. Any version numbers associated with items edited as a result of the change should be incremented at their lowest level of significance. If, however, the change has an impact on the meaning of the item, then a new item should be created and the existing (erroneous) item marked as deprecated. This situation is considered a minor adjustment according to 3.3.1 above.

Note: An example of an item for which this type of change applies is a code list entry for the Table Driven Code Forms or WMO Core Metadata Profile, in which the description contains typographical errors that can be corrected without changing the meaning of the description.

Figure 4. Adoption of amendments during CBS sessions

=== 6.2 Correcting an error in the specification of how conformance with the requirements of the Manual can be checked

If an erroneous specification of a conformance-checking rule is found, the preferred approach is to add a new specification using the simple (fast-track) procedure or standard (adoption of amendments between CBS sessions) procedure. The new conformance-checking rule should be used instead of the old. An appropriate explanation shall be added to the description of the conformance-checking rule to clarify the practice along with the date of the change.

Note: An example of such a change would be correcting a conformance-checking rule in the WMO Core Metadata Profile.

=== 6.3 Submission of corrections to errors

Such changes shall be submitted through the simple (fast-track) procedure.

== 7. VALIDATION PROCEDURE

=== 7.1 Documentation of need and purpose

The need for, and the purpose of, the proposal for changes should be documented.

=== 7.2 Documentation of result

This documentation shall include the results of validation testing of the proposal as described in 7.3 below.

=== 7.3 Testing with relevant applications

For changes that have an impact on automated processing systems, the extent of the testing required before validation should be decided by the designated committee on a case-by-case basis, depending on the nature of the change. Changes involving a relatively high risk and/or impact on the systems should be tested by the use of at least two independently developed tool sets and two independent centres. In that case, results should be made available to the designated committee with a view to verifying the technical specifications.

Geopotential. That potential with which the Earth’s gravitational field is associated. It is equivalent to the potential energy of unit mass relative to a standard level (mean sea level by convention) and is numerically equal to the work which would be done against gravity in raising the unit mass from sea level to the level at which the mass is located.

Geopotential _ϕ_ at geometric height _z_ is given by

where _g_ is the acceleration of gravity.

Geopotential height. Height of a point in the atmosphere expressed in units (geopotential metres) proportional to the geopotential at that height. Geopotential height expressed in geopotential metres is approximately equal to _g_/9.8 times the geometric height expressed in (geometric) metres, _g_ being the local acceleration of gravity.

Ocean weather station. A station aboard a suitably equipped and staffed ship that endeavours to remain at a fixed sea position and that makes and reports surface and upper-air observations and may also make and report subsurface observations.

Operator descriptor. A descriptor containing a code figure reference to BUFR or CREX Table C, together with data to be used as an operand.

Past weather. Predominant characteristic of weather which had existed at the station during a given period of time.

Persistent condensation trail. Long-lived condensation trails which have spread to form clouds having the appearance of cirrus or patches of cirrocumulus or cirrostratus. It is sometimes impossible to distinguish such clouds from other cirrus, cirrocumulus or cirrostratus.

Present weather. Weather existing at the time of observation, or under certain conditions, during the hour preceding the time of observation.

Prevailing visibility. The greatest visibility value, observed in accordance with the definition of "visibility", which is reached within at least half the horizon circle or within at least half of the surface of the aerodrome. These areas could comprise contiguous or non-contiguous sectors.

Note: This value may be assessed by human observation and/or instrumented systems. When instruments are installed, they are used to obtain the best estimate of the prevailing visibility.

Purple light. Glow with a hue varying between pink and red, which is to be seen in the direction of the Sun before it rises and after it sets and is about 3° to 6° below the horizon. It takes the form of a segment of a more or less large luminous disc which appears above the horizon.

Reference value. All data are represented within a BUFR or CREX message by positive integers; to enable negative values to be represented, suitable negative base values are specified as reference values. The true value is obtained by addition of the reference value and the data as represented.

Replication descriptor. A special descriptor is reserved to define the replication operation; it is used to enable a given number of subsequent descriptors to be replicated a given number of times.

Root element. Each XML document has exactly one root element. This element, also known as the document element, encloses all the other elements and is therefore the sole parent element to all the other elements. The root element provides the starting point for processing the document.

Runway visual range. The range over which the pilot of an aircraft on the centre line of the runway can see the runway markings or the lights delineating the runway or identifying its centre line.

Schematron. A definition language for making assertions about patterns found in XML documents, differing in basic concept from other schema languages in that it is not based on grammars but on finding patterns in the parsed document.

Sea station. An observing station situated at sea. Sea stations include ships, ocean weather stations and stations on fixed or drifting platforms (rigs, platforms, lightships and buoys).

Section. A logical subdivision of a BUFR or CREX message, to aid description and definition.

Sequence descriptor. A descriptor used as a code figure to reference a single entry in BUFR or CREX Table D; the referenced entry contains a list of descriptors to be substituted for the sequence descriptor.

Severe line squall. Severe squall which occurs along squall line (see _Line squall_).

Snow haze. A suspension in the air of numerous minute snow particles, considerably reducing the visibility at the Earth’s surface (visibility in snow haze often decreases to 50 m). Snow haze is observed most frequently in Arctic regions, before or after a snowstorm.

Squall. Atmospheric phenomenon characterized by a very large variation of wind speed: it begins suddenly, has a duration of the order of minutes and decreases rather suddenly in speed. It is often accompanied by a shower or thunderstorm.

Squall line. Fictitious moving line, sometimes of considerable extent, along which squall phenomena occur.

Sun pillar. Pillar of white light, which may or may not be continuous, which may be observed vertically above or below the sun. Sun pillars are most frequently observed near sunrise or sunset; they may extend to about 20° above the Sun, and generally end in a point. When a sun pillar appears together with a well-developed parhelic circle, a sun cross may appear at their intersection.

Synoptic hour. Hour, expressed in terms of universal time coordinated (UTC), at which, by international agreement, meteorological observations are made simultaneously throughout the globe.

Synoptic observation. A surface or upper-air observation made at standard time.

Synoptic surface observation. Synoptic observation, other than an upper-air observation, made by an observer or an automatic weather station on the Earth’s surface.

Template. Description of the standardized layout of a set of data entities.

Tropical (Tropic). Pertaining to that region of the Earth’s surface lying between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn at 23° 30´ N and S, respectively.

Tropical cyclone. Cyclone of tropical origin of small diameter (some hundreds of kilometres) with minimum surface pressure in some cases less than 900 hPa, very violent winds and torrential rain; sometimes accompanied by thunderstorms. It usually contains a central region, known as the “eye” of the storm, with a diameter of the order of some tens of kilometres, and with light winds and more or less lightly clouded sky.

Tropical revolving storm. Tropical cyclone.

*Tropopause.*

{empty}(1) Upper limit of the troposphere. By convention, the “first tropopause” is defined as the lowest level at which the lapse rate decreases to 2 °C km^–1^ or less, provided also the average lapse rate between this level and all higher levels within 2 km does not exceed 2 °C km^–1^.

{empty}(2) If, above the first tropopause, the average lapse rate between any level and all higher levels within 1 km exceeds 3 °C km^–1^, then a “second tropopause” is defined by the same criterion as under (1). This second tropopause may be either within or above the 1-km layer.

Twilight glow. See _Purple light_.

Twilight glow in the mountains (Alpenglühen). See _Alpine glow_.

Uniform resource identifier (URI). A compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource. URI syntax is defined in the Internet Engineering Task Force (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt[IETF) RFC 3986].

Unit of geopotential (_H~m'~_). 1 standard geopotential metre = 0.980 665 dynamic metre

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|where |_g(z)_ |= |acceleration of gravity, in m s^–2^, as a function of geometric height;
| |_z_ |= |geometric height, in metres;
| |_H~m'~_ |= |geopotential, in geopotential metres.
|===

Vertical visibility. Maximum distance at which an observer can see and identify an object on the same vertical as himself, above or below

Visibility (for aeronautical purposes). Visibility for aeronautical purposes is the greater of:

{empty}(a) The greatest distance at which a black object of suitable dimensions, situated near the ground, can be seen and recognized when observed against a bright background;

{empty}(b) The greatest distance at which lights in the vicinity of 1 000 candelas can be seen and identified against an unlit background.

Note: The two distances have different values in air of a given extinction coefficient, and the latter (b) varies with the background illumination. The former (a) is represented by the meteorological optical range (MOR).

Whiteout. Uniformly white appearance of the landscape when the ground is snow covered and the sky is uniformly covered with clouds. An atmospheric optical phenomenon of the polar regions in which the observer appears to be engulfed in a uniformly white glow. Neither shadows, horizon, nor clouds are discernible; sense of depth and orientation are lost; only very dark, nearby objects can be seen. Whiteout occurs over an unbroken snow cover and beneath a uniformly overcast sky, when, with the aid of the snowblink effect, the light from the sky is about equal to that from the snow surface. Blowing snow may be an additional cause. The phenomenon is experienced in the air as well as on the ground.

Wind (mean wind, spot wind). Air motion relative to the Earth’s surface. Unless it is otherwise specified, only the horizontal component is considered.

{empty}(1) _Mean wind_: For the purpose of upper air reports from aircraft, mean wind is derived from the drift of the aircraft when flying from one fixed point to another or obtained by flying on a circuit around a fixed observed point and an immediate wind deduced from the drift of the aircraft.

{empty}(2) _Spot wind_: For the purpose of upper-air reports from aircraft, the wind velocity, observed or predicted, for a specified location, height and time.

XML attribute. A start tag delimiting an XML element may contain one or more attributes. Attributes are Name-Value pairs, with the Name in each pair referred to as the attribute name and the Value (the text between the quote delimiters, that is, ' or ") as the attribute value. The order of attribute specifications in a start-tag or empty-element tag is not significant.

XML document. A structured document conforming to the rules specified in Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition).

XML element. Each XML document contains one or more elements, the boundaries of which are either delimited by start-tags and end-tags, or, for empty elements, by an empty-element tag. Each element has a type, identified by name, sometimes called its generic identifier (GI), and may have a set of attribute specifications. An XML element may contain other XML elements, XML attributes or character data.

XML schema. A definition language offering facilities for describing the structure and constraining the contents of XML documents. The set of definitions for describing a particular XML document structure and associated constraints is referred to as an XML schema document.

XML schema document (XSD). An XML document containing XML schema component definitions and declarations.

Zodiacal light. White or yellowish light which spreads out, in the night sky, more or less along the zodiac from the horizon on the side on which the Sun is hidden. It is observed when the sky is sufficiently dark and the atmosphere sufficiently clear.

FM SYSTEM OF NUMBERING XML MARKUP LANGUAGE APPLICATION SCHEMAS

Each XML application schema bears a number, preceded by the letters FM. This number is followed by a numeral to identify the session of the Commission for Basic Systems (CBS) that either approved the XML application schema as a new one or made the latest amendment to its previous version. An XML application schema approved or amended by correspondence after a CBS session receives the number of that session.

Furthermore, an indicator term is used to designate the XML representation colloquially and is therefore called a "code name".

Notes on nomenclature:

{empty}(a) Changes and augmentations to the structure of the XML data representation shall be identified as different “editions”. Each edition of the XML code is allocated a unique namespace. To distinguish between editions, namespaces include EITHER a year field, denoting the year in which those changes and augmentations were begun, OR a version number. For example, FM 202-16 METCE-XML has the namespace http://def.wmo.int/metce/2013 (initial year of work 2013) whilst FM 205-16 IWXXM-XML has the namespace http://icao.int/iwxxm/2.1 (version number 2.1).

{empty}(b) Changes to the content of any of the supporting tables are backward compatible. Terms used within the supporting tables may be deprecated; they will not be deleted. Once changes to the supporting tables are approved, a snapshot containing all the supporting tables required for XML codes will be published. Each snapshot is referred to as a “table version”. The current table version for XML codes is Version 1.

{empty}(c) Backward-compatible changes, including addition of new elements or attributes to supporting tables, do not require a new edition of the XML code.

{empty}(d) Further XML code editions and table versions may be generated independently of one another in the future as requirements dictate.

The following table lists XML application schemas included within the FM numbering system, together with the corresponding code names and their reference list of approval decisions of the World Meteorological Congress, the Executive Council or CBS.

==== 1. Representation of information in extensible markup language

1.1 XML documents shall be well-formed with respect to XML 1.0 [Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)].

Notes:

{empty}1. The XML implementation specified in this Manual is described using the XML schema definition language (XSD) [XML Schema Part 1: Structures (Second Edition), XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes (Second Edition)] and Schematron [ISO/IEC 19757-3:2006, Information technology – Document Schema Definition Languages (DSDL) – Part 3: Rule-based validation – Schematron].

{empty}2. Within this Manual, XPath [XML Path Language (XPath) 2.0 (Second Edition)] is used to refer to particular elements and attributes within an XML document.

1.2 XML documents conforming to XML schema that have been allocated an FM identifier within this Manual shall, in addition to conforming to the Regulation for the specified code form, conform to the requirements specified in clause 2.4 of ISO 19136:2007 [ISO 19136:2007, Geographic information – Geography Markup Language (GML)].

Notes:

{empty}1. XML schemas defined in this Manual are conformant to the encoding rules specified in ISO 19136:2007 and are categorized as “GML application schema”. Similarly, XML documents conforming to requirements from ISO 19136:2007 are termed “GML documents”.

{empty}2. Conformance tests for GML documents are provided in ISO 19136:2007, Annex A, A.3 – Abstract test suite for GML documents.

{empty}3. The Content-Type [IETF RFC 2387 MIME Multipart/Related Content-type] for GML documents is “application/gml+xml”.

1.3 Information exchanged in XML using the WMO Information System (WIS) shall conform to publicly available GML application schemas.

1.4 Information that is exchanged as XML using WIS and that is capable of being represented according to the GML application schemas defined in this Manual should conform to the GML application schemas defined within this Manual.

1.5 Creators of GML documents conforming to the GML application schemas defined in this Manual shall ensure that their GML documents are valid with respect to the associated XML schema documents (XSD).

1.6 Creators of GML documents conforming to the GML application schemas defined in this Manual shall ensure that their GML documents validate against the associated Schematron schema(s) that test conformance with the specified GML application schema.

Note: It is not necessary for recipients to validate each document.

1.7 All date-time elements shall be encoded using ISO 8601 extended time format [ISO 8601:2004, Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times].

1.8 The value of each time element shall include a time zone definition according to the ISO 8601 standard. The time zone provided should be universal time coordinated (UTC).

Note: A time zone is specified using a signed four-digit character or a “Z” to represent Zulu or UTC according to the following regular expression: (Z|[+-]HH:MM).

1.9 All units of measure shall use the appropriate code from the Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM) code system. The unit of measure shall be identified by encoding the UCUM code in the “uom” attribute of the gml:MeasureType. Where no UCUM code is provided for the unit of measure, the unit of measure should be identified using a URI that resolves to an online definition that is recognized by some level of authority.

Notes:

{empty}1. The UCUM base codes are available in XML form at http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum-essence.xml.

{empty}2. A list of units of measure appropriate to the weather, water and climate domains are provided at http://codes.wmo.int/common/unit. Each unit of measurement listed therein has a URI identifier.

1.10 Where an xlink:href attribute is used to reference a resource from within an XML document, the xlink:title attribute should not be used to provide a textual description of that resource.

==== 2. Unique identifiers to identify code table items and definitions

2.1 The GML application schemas defined in this Manual make extensive use of externally managed codes and vocabulary items, with the majority drawn from code tables or code lists in Volumes I.1 and I.2.

2.2 Code or vocabulary items are referenced from within XML documents using the xlink:href attribute [XML Linking Language (XLink) Version 1.1].

2.3 The target code table or vocabulary from which codes or vocabulary items shall, should or may be drawn is defined within the GML application schema using the //annotation/appinfo/vocabulary element within the XML type definition.

2.4 The level of validation applied when assessing membership of codes or vocabulary items within the target code table or vocabulary is defined within the GML application schema using the //annotation/appinfo/extensibility element within the XML type definition. The interpretation of extensibility is as follows:

{empty}(a) <extensibility> “none” indicates that codes or vocabulary items shall be drawn from the target code table or vocabulary;

{empty}(b) <extensibility> “narrower” indicates that codes or vocabulary items shall be drawn from the target code table or vocabulary, or that the code or vocabulary item used shall be derived from another term within the target code table or vocabulary using a more refined, or narrower, definition;

{empty}(c) <extensibility> “any” indicates that codes or vocabulary items may be drawn from the target code table, code list or vocabulary or any other code table or vocabulary deemed appropriate by the author.

2.5 Code or vocabulary items referenced from within GML documents should have an available online definition and have been recognized by some level of authority.

2.6 Each code list managed by WMO in support of XML application schemas shall have a unique identifier of the form: http://codes.wmo.int/<identifier>.

Notes:

{empty}1. The recommended practice for selecting <identifier> is to base it on the WMO number of the publication defining the appropriate regulation, and the table within that publication. An example of a unique identifier is http://codes.wmo.int/306/4678/BLSN.

{empty}2. WMO provides a web service that makes the unique references “resolvable”. This means that if a unique identifier, such as http://codes.wmo.int/306/4678/BLSN, is entered as a URL into a browser, the definition of the item corresponding to the unique reference is displayed.

==== 3. Tables and code lists supporting the WMO Logical Data Model

===== 3.1 Application of code tables and code lists

Regulations specified in code tables or code lists in Volumes I.1 and I.2 shall apply to the corresponding entries in code tables used within the GML application schemas defined in this Manual.

===== 3.2 Nil reasons

3.2.1 Nil-reason terms from Code table D-1 shall, where permitted within the GML application schemas defined in this Manual, be used to provide an explanation for recording a missing (or void) value within a GML document.

Notes:

{empty}1. Code table D-1 is described in Appendix A.

{empty}2. Code table D-1 is published online at http://codes.wmo.int/common/nil.

3.2.2 Each nil-reason term is identified with a URI [IETF RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax]. The URI shall comprise the “Code-space” column concatenated with the “Notation” column of Code table D-1.

===== 3.3 Physical quantities

3.3.1 Terms from Code table D-2 shall be used within the GML application schemas defined in this Manual to describe physical quantity kinds.

3.3.2 Each physical quantity kind is identified with a URI [IETF RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax]. The URI shall comprise the path http://codes.wmo.int/common/quantity-kind concatenated with the value listed in the “Notation” column of Code table D-2.

FM 201: COLLECTION OF REPORTS

FM 201-15 EXT. COLLECT-XML Collection of reports

201-15-Ext.1 Scope

COLLECT-XML shall be used to represent a collection of GML feature instances of the same type of meteorological information. The intent is to allow XML encoded meteorological information to be packaged in a way that emulates the existing data distribution practices used within the Global Telecommunication System and aeronautical fixed service (AFS).

Notes:

{empty}1. The collection of meteorological information is often referred to as a bulletin.

{empty}2. XML encodings of meteorological information are defined in this Manual; for example, FM 205-15 EXT. IWXXM‑XML.

{empty}3. Aggregation of meteorological information in the form of meteorological bulletins usually takes place at a station or centre originating or compiling the bulletin, as agreed internationally. A meteorological bulletin may have one or more instances of meteorological information. If meteorological reports of routine messages are not available during compilation, a NIL report of that station should be included in the published contents of the bulletin.

The requirements classes defined in COLLECT-XML are listed in Table 201-15-Ext.1.

===== 202-15-Ext.3 Virtual typing

In accordance with OMXML (clause 7.2), the specialization of OM_Observation is provided through Schematron restriction. The om:type element shall be used to specify the type of OM_Observation that is being encoded using the URI for the corresponding observation type listed in Code table D-3.

Notes:

{empty}1. Code table D-3 is described in Appendix A.

{empty}2. Code table D-3 is published online at http://codes.wmo.int/common/observation-type/METCE/2013.

{empty}3. The URI for each observation type is composed by appending the _notation_ to the _code-space_. As an example, the URI of ComplexSamplingMeasurement is http://codes.wmo.int/common/observation-type/METCE/2013/ComplexSamplingMeasurement.

{empty}4. Each URI will resolve to provide further information about the associated observation type.

{empty}5. The terms “observation” and “measurement” evoke a particular concept to meteorologists (for example, the measurement of a physical phenomenon using an instrument or sensor). As defined in ISO 19156:2011, Geographic information – Observations and measurements, an instance of OM_Observation is defined as an “estimate of the value of some property of some feature of interest using a specified procedure”. OM_Measurement is clearly applicable to the measurement of some physical property values using an instrument or sensor but is equally applicable to the numerical simulation of physical property values using a computational model (for example, a forecast or reanalysis).

===== 202-15-Ext.4 Requirements class: Complex sampling measurement

202-15-Ext.4.1 This requirements class restricts the content model for the XML element om:OM_Observation such that the “result” of the observation is a set of values relating to a specified location and time instant or duration, the “feature of interest” is a representative subset of the atmosphere or body of water and so forth based on a predetermined sampling regime and the “procedure” provides the set of information as specified by WMO.

Note: ComplexSamplingMeasurement (a subclass of OM_ComplexObservation) is intended for use where the observation event is concerned with the evaluation of multiple measurands at a specified location and time instant or duration. OM_ComplexObservation is used because the “result” of this class of observations is a group of measures, provided as a Record (as defined in ISO 19103:2005, Geographic information – Conceptual schema language).

202-15-Ext.4.2 Instances of om:OM_Observation with element om:type specifying http://codes.wmo.int/common/observation-type/METCE/2013/ComplexSamplingMeasurement shall conform to all requirements specified in Table 202-15-Ext.4.

202-15-Ext.4.3 Instances of om:OM_Observation with element om:type specifying http://codes.wmo.int/common/observation-type/METCE/2013/ComplexSamplingMeasurement shall conform to all requirements of all relevant dependencies specified in Table 202-15-Ext.4.

Note: XML implementation of metce:ComplexSamplingMeasurement is dependent on:

===== 202-15-Ext.5 Requirements class: Sampling coverage measurement

202-15-Ext.5.1 This requirements class restricts the content model for the XML element om:OM_Observation such that the “result” of the observation is a set of values describing the variation of properties with space and/or time, the “feature of interest” is a representative subset of the atmosphere or body of water and so forth based on a predetermined sampling regime and the “procedure” provides the set of information as specified by WMO.

Notes:

{empty}1. SamplingCoverageMeasurement (a subclass of OM_DiscreteCoverageObservation) is intended for use where the observation event is concerned with the evaluation of measurands that vary with respect to space and/or time. OM_DiscreteCoverageObservation is used because the “result” of this class of observations is a discrete coverage (as defined in ISO 19123:2005 Geographic information – Schema for coverage geometry and functions).

{empty}2. SamplingCoverageMeasurement is based on the informative SamplingCoverageObservation specialization of OM_Observation outlined in ISO 19156:2011, clause D.3.4. Within METCE, additional restrictions are applied to the “procedure”. Furthermore, the name is changed from SamplingCoverageObservation to SamplingCoverageMeasurement in an attempt to disambiguate the two classes and to mitigate confusion arising from use of the term observation.

202-15-Ext.5.2 Instances of om:OM_Observation with element om:type specifying http://codes.wmo.int/common/observation-type/METCE/2013/SamplingCoverageMeasurement shall conform to all requirements specified in Table 202-15-Ext.5.

===== 202-15-Ext.6 Requirements class: Sampling observation

202-15-Ext.6.1 This requirements class restricts the content model for the XML element om:OM_Observation such that the “feature of interest” is a representative subset of the atmosphere or body of water and so forth based on a predetermined sampling regime and the “procedure” provides the set of information as specified by WMO.

Note: SamplingObservation (a subclass of OM_Observation) is the most flexible of the three observation specializations defined in METCE, as it adds no additional constraints on the type of “result”.

202-15-Ext.6.2 Where the semantics of one’s application are appropriate, ComplexSamplingMeasurement or SamplingCoverageMeasurement should be used in preference to SamplingObservation, as it is anticipated that software applications will be more readily able to parse and process data conforming to the former two observation types due to their more structured “result” types.

202-15-Ext.6.3 Instances of om:OM_Observation with element om:type specifying http://codes.wmo.int/common/observation-type/METCE/2013/SamplingObservation shall conform to all requirements specified in Table 202-15-Ext.6.

===== 202-15-Ext.10 Requirements class: Process

202-15-Ext.10.1 This requirements class is used to describe the procedures involved in generating an observation or measurement.

Notes:

{empty}1. Process provides a concrete implementation of the abstract OM_Process class.

{empty}2. An instance of Process is often an instrument or sensor (perhaps even a sensor in a given calibrated state), but it may be a human observer executing a set of repeatable instructions, a simulator or a process algorithm.

{empty}3. Process is intended to allow the provision of reference(s) to supporting documentation (for example, online documentation describing the procedure in detail) plus the resolution (for example, the smallest quantity being measured that causes a perceptible change in the corresponding indication) and measuring interval (for example, the range of values for a given quantity kind that an instrument or sensor can detect under the defined conditions) for each physical quantity kind observed.

{empty}4. Process is targeted at providing a basic process description; representations providing more detailed information may be used if required.

202-15-Ext.10.2 An instance of Process should provide sufficient information for one to interpret the result of an observation.

Note: The recalibration of a sensor such as an anemometer, or modifying its height above local ground, is likely to affect the values that that sensor records; a new instance of Process may be required to express such changes enabling accurate interpretation of the observation result.

202-15-Ext.10.3 XML elements describing procedures relating to observations or measurements shall conform to all requirements specified in Table 202-15-Ext.10.

|Recommendation a|
http://def.wmo.int/metce/2013/req/xsd-process/configuration

Where more information about the procedure configuration is available, such as details of a sensor’s calibration or deployment environment, that information should be included in the procedure description. For each configuration item, an XML element metce:parameter should be provided, each with a child element om:NamedValue. XML element //metce:parameter/om:NamedValue/om:name should indicate the meaning of the parameter. The parameter name should be taken from a well-governed source. Furthermore, to avoid ambiguity, there should be no more than one parameter with the same name within a given procedure description. XML element //metce:parameter/om:NamedValue/om:value provides the value of the parameter using any suitable concrete type.

|Recommendation a|
http://def.wmo.int/metce/2013/req/xsd-process/measurement-context

Where additional information about the quantity kind(s) observed or measured by the procedure, such as qualification or constraint of the quantity kind, or details of the resolution and/or range with which the procedure is able to measure a given quantity kind is available, that information should be included in the procedure description. For each quantity kind for which additional information is to be provided, an XML element metce:context should be provided, each with a child element metce:MeasurementContext (or any element of a substitution group of metce:MeasurementContext).

|===

Note: Where a procedure is common for many observations, the metce:Process describing that procedure may be published online at an accessible location and referenced from each observation using xlink:href to indicate the URL.

===== 202-15-Ext.11 Requirements class: Measurement context

202-15-Ext.11.1 This requirements class is used to describe the additional context that may be provided for a quantity kind measured by a given procedure.

Note: The measurement context allows the resolution scale (for example, the smallest change in quantity being measured that causes a perceptible change in the corresponding indication) and/or the measuring interval (for example, the range of values that can be measured) to be defined for a given quantity kind for the associated procedure. For example, it is possible to state that a given procedure, say a thermometer, is able to measure air temperature to a resolution of 0.5 degree Celsius in the range –30 degrees Celsius to +50 degrees Celsius.

202-15-Ext.11.2 XML elements describing procedures relating to observations or measurements shall conform to all requirements specified in Table 202-15-Ext.11.

202-15-Ext.11.3 XML elements describing procedures relating to observations or measurements shall conform to all requirements of all relevant dependencies specified in Table 202-15-Ext.11.

|Requirement a|
http://def.wmo.int/metce/2013/req/xsd-measurement-context/unit-of-measure-provision

Where either XML elements metce:resolutionScale or metce:measuringInterval or both are present, XML element metce:unitOfMeasure shall be provided.

|Requirement a|
http://def.wmo.int/metce/2013/req/xsd-measurement-context/measuring-interval-range-bounds-order

Where the measuring interval is specified, the lower limit of the interval, expressed via XML element //metce:measuringInterval/metce:RangeBounds/metce:rangeStart, shall be less than the upper limit of the interval, expressed via XML element //metce:measuringInterval/metce:RangeBounds/metce:rangeEnd.

|===

Notes:

{empty}1. The XML element metce:measurand may reference a quantity kind provided by some authority using xlink:href to indicate the URI of the quantity kind, or provide a child element opm:ObservableProperty (or element within the substitution group of opm:ObservableProperty). The latter case may be useful where additional qualification or constraint relating to the quantity kind needs to be embedded within the GML document as XML element //om:OM_Observation/om:observedProperty only permits the observed quantity kind to be expressed by reference using xlink:href.

{empty}2. Units of measurement are specified in accordance with 1.9 above.

===== 202-16.3 Virtual typing

In accordance with OMXML (clause 7.2), the specialization of OM_Observation is provided through Schematron restriction. The om:type element shall be used to specify the type of OM_Observation that is being encoded using the URI for the corresponding observation type listed in Code table D-3.

Notes:

{empty}1. Code table D-3 is described in Appendix A.

{empty}2. Code table D-3 is published online at http://codes.wmo.int/common/observation-type/METCE/2013.

{empty}3. The URI for each observation type is composed by appending the _notation_ to the _code-space_. As an example, the URI of DiscreteTimeSeriesObservation is http://codes.wmo.int/common/observation-type/METCE/2013/DiscreteTimeSeriesObservation.

{empty}4. Each URI will resolve to provide further information about the associated observation type.

{empty}5. The terms “observation” and “measurement” evoke a particular concept to meteorologists (for example, the measurement of a physical phenomenon using an instrument or sensor). As defined in ISO 19156:2011, Geographic information – Observations and measurements, an instance of OM_Observation is defined as an “estimate of the value of some property of some feature of interest using a specified procedure”. OM_Measurement is clearly applicable to the measurement of some physical property values using an instrument or sensor but is equally applicable to the numerical simulation of physical property values using a computational model (for example, a forecast or reanalysis).

Furthermore, to avoid ambiguity, there should be no more than one parameter with the same name within a given procedure description. XML element //metce:parameter/om:NamedValue/om:value provides the value of the parameter using any suitable concrete type.

|Recommendation a|
http://def.wmo.int/metce/2013/req/xsd-process/measurement-context

Where additional information about the quantity kind(s) observed or measured by the procedure, such as qualification or constraint of the quantity kind, or details of the resolution and/or range with which the procedure is able to measure a given quantity kind is available, that information should be included in the procedure description. For each quantity kind for which additional information is to be provided, an XML element metce:context should be provided, each with a child element metce:MeasurementContext (or any element of a substitution group of metce:MeasurementContext).

|===

Note: Where a procedure is common for many observations, the metce:Process describing that procedure may be published online at an accessible location and referenced from each observation using xlink:href to indicate the URL.

===== 202-16.11 Requirements class: Measurement context

202-16.11.1 This requirements class is used to describe the additional context that may be provided for a quantity kind measured by a given procedure.

Note: The measurement context allows the resolution scale (for example, the smallest change in quantity being measured that causes a perceptible change in the corresponding indication) and/or the measuring interval (for example, the range of values that can be measured) to be defined for a given quantity kind for the associated procedure. For example, it is possible to state that a given procedure, say a thermometer, is able to measure air temperature to a resolution of 0.5 degree Celsius in the range –30 degrees Celsius to +50 degrees Celsius.

202-16.11.2 XML elements describing procedures relating to observations or measurements shall conform to all requirements specified in Table 202-16.8.

202-16.11.3 XML elements describing procedures relating to observations or measurements shall conform to all requirements of all relevant dependencies specified in Table 202-16.8.

|Requirement a|
http://def.wmo.int/metce/2013/req/xsd-measurement-context/unit-of-measure-provision

Where either XML elements metce:resolutionScale or metce:measuringInterval or both are present, XML element metce:unitOfMeasure shall be provided.

|Requirement a|
http://def.wmo.int/metce/2013/req/xsd-measurement-context/measuring-interval-range-bounds-order

Notes:

{empty}1. The XML element metce:measurand may reference a quantity kind provided by some authority using xlink:href to indicate the URI of the quantity kind, or provide a child element opm:ObservableProperty (or element within the substitution group of opm:ObservableProperty). The latter case may be useful where additional qualification or constraint relating to the quantity kind needs to be embedded within the GML document as XML element //om:OM_Observation/om:observedProperty only permits the observed quantity kind to be expressed by reference using xlink:href.

{empty}2. Units of measurement are specified in accordance with 1.9 above.

===== 202-16.12 Requirements class: Generic observation data

202-16.12.1 This requirements class mandates use of the XML element om:OM_Observation for encoding observation data.

Note: The term ““observation” evokes a particular concept to meteorologists: the measurement of physical phenomena using a human observer, instrument or sensor. However, OM_Observation, as defined in ISO 19156:2011, provides a generalized pattern for describing an event that estimates the value(s) of a property for a subject using a specified process. These semantics are equally applicable to describe forecasts and other numerical simulations.

OPM-XML shall be used to represent complex observable properties (also known as quantity kinds) where individual observable properties are aggregated into groups or where the qualification and/or constraint applied to an observable property needs to be explicitly described.

Notes:

{empty}1. An “observable property” is a physical property that can be observed; typically this will be a quantitative property, such as dewpoint temperature.

{empty}2. OPM, the Observable Property Model, was developed to a draft level by the Open Geospatial Consortium Sensor Web Enablement Domain Working Group and was re-used in the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model. It is published by WMO to ensure that there is a stable definition of its XML schemas.

{empty}3. The Observable Property Model application schema is described in the _Guidelines on Data Modelling for WMO Codes_ (available in English only from http://wis.wmo.int/metce-uml).

The requirements classes defined in OPM-XML are listed in Table 203-15-Ext.1.

//opmStatisticalQualifier/opm:aggregationArea, //opmStatisticalQualifier/opm:aggregationLength, //opmStatisticalQualifier/opm:aggregationTimePeriod or +
//opmStatisticalQualifier/opm:aggregationVolume should be used in preference to XML element //opmStatisticalQualifier/opm:otherAggregation to describe the statistical qualification domain.

|===

Notes:

{empty}1. Groups of statistical qualifiers may be applied to a given base property; in such a case the order of the statistical qualification is important. For example, mean daily maximum temperature over a one-month period comprises two statistical operations with respect to the base property “air temperature” – a maximum over a 24-hour duration followed by a mean over a one-month duration. A collection of statistical qualifiers can be linked using the XML element //opmStatisticalQualifier/opm:derivedFrom to establish an ordered set.

{empty}2. Terms from Volume I.2, FM 92 GRIB, Code table 4.10: Type of statistical processing, may be used to describe the statistical function. An alternative source of statistical function codes is provided in Volume I.2, FM 94 BUFR, Code table 0 08 023: First-order statistics. For convenience, these code tables have been published online at http://codes.wmo.int/grib2/codeflag/4.10 and http://codes.wmo.int/bufr4/codeflag/0-08-023, respectively.

203-15-Ext.7 Requirements class: Constraint

203-15-Ext.7.1 This requirements class is used to describe the representation of constraints applied to an observable property.

Notes:

{empty}1. The observable property that is used to constrain the base property is known as the constraining property. For example, the observed property “radiance” may be constrained such that one is concerned only with the radiance between wavelengths of 50 nm to 100 nm – in which case the constraining property is “wavelength”.

{empty}2. Representations providing more detailed information, such as scalar constraint, range constraint or category constraint, may be used if required.

203-15-Ext.7.2 XML elements describing the constraint of observable properties shall conform to all requirements specified in Table 203-15-Ext.8.

|===

203-15-Ext.8 Requirements class: Category constraint

203-15-Ext.8.1 This requirements class is used to describe the representation of category-based constraints applied to an observable property.

Note: For example, where one is interested only in the cloud-base height of convective clouds, the base property is “cloud-base height”, the constraining property is “cloud type” and the values of the category constraint element list the particular cloud types of interest (for example, cumulonimbus and towering cumulus.).

203-15-Ext.8.2 XML elements describing a category-based constraint of observable properties shall conform to all requirements specified in Table 203-15-Ext.9.

203-15-Ext.8.3 XML elements describing a category-based constraint of observable properties shall conform to all requirements of all relevant dependencies specified in Table 203-15-Ext.9.

http://def.wmo.int/opm/2013/req/xsd-category-constraint/category-value-code-space

The XML attribute //opm:CategoryConstraint/opm:value/@gml:codeSpace should be provided when specifying each category member.

|Recommendation a|
http://def.wmo.int/opm/2013/req/xsd-category-constraint/category-value-online-definition

Appending the content of the XML element //opm:CategoryConstraint/opm:value to the content of XML attribute //opm:CategoryConstraint/opm:value/@gml:codeSpace should create a URI that resolves to an online definition that is recognized by some authority.

|===

203-15-Ext.9 Requirements class: Scalar constraint

203-15-Ext.9.1 This requirements class is used to describe the representation of scalar constraints applied to an observable property.

Note: For example, the base property “air temperature” may be constrained such that one is concerned only with air temperature at 1.2 metres above the local ground level (for example, a screen temperature); height above local ground level is the constraining property.

203-15-Ext.9.2 XML elements describing the scalar constraint of observable properties shall conform to all requirements specified in Table 203-15-Ext.10.

203-15-Ext.9.3 XML elements describing the scalar constraint of observable properties shall conform to all requirements of all relevant dependencies specified in Table 203-15-Ext.10.

|Requirement a|
http://def.wmo.int/opm/2013/req/xsd-scalar-constraint/unit-of-measure

|===

Note: Units of measurement are specified in accordance with 1.9 above.

203-15-Ext.10 Requirements class: Range constraint

203-15-Ext.10.1 This requirements class is used to describe the representation of constraints applied to an observable property according to a range of values.

Note: For example, the base property “radiance” may be constrained such that one is only concerned with radiance between wavelengths of 50 nm and 100 nm – “wavelength” is the constraining property and is limited to the range 50 nm to 100 nm.

203-15-Ext.10.2 XML elements describing the range constraint of observable properties shall conform to all requirements specified in Table 203-15-Ext.11.

204-15-Ext.3 Requirements class: Unique identification

204-15-Ext.3.1 This requirements class is used to describe how the information representations of aeronautical features are identified.

Notes:

{empty}1. Examples of aeronautical features include aerodromes, air traffic management units and flight information regions.

{empty}2. To achieve consistency with the Aeronautical Information Exchange Model (AIXM 5), the method of identification defined therein is adopted here. More details may be found in the document “AIXM 5 Feature Identification and Reference”.

{empty}3. The identifier does not identify the real-world aeronautical feature itself; rather, it identifies the information representation about a given aeronautical feature. The originator of information about a given aeronautical feature uniquely identifies the information record it maintains within its data management systems about a given real-world aeronautical feature. The same identifier is then re-used in downstream information systems when referring to that information record. This ensures that all parties can be confident that they are working with the same information about a given aeronautical feature. Thus, if multiple systems use the same identifier for an aeronautical feature, this indicates (i) the data are from the same source, or (ii) there are processes in place to ensure the consistency of data between those systems.

204-15-Ext.3.2 XML elements describing aeronautical features shall conform to all requirements specified in Table 204-15-Ext.4.

204-15-Ext.3.3 XML elements describing aeronautical features shall conform to all requirements of all relevant dependencies specified in Table 204-15-Ext.4.

{empty}4. If XML attribute @automatedStation is absent, then the value “false” is inferred; for example, the meteorological aerodrome observation included within the report has not been generated by an automated system.

{empty}5. Within an XML encoded meteorological aerodrome report, it is likely that only one instance of saf:Aerodrome will physically be present; subsequent assertions about the aerodrome may use xlinks to refer to the previously defined saf:Aerodrome element in order to keep the XML document size small. As such, validation of requirement http://icao.int/iwxxm/1.1/req/xsd-meteorological-aerodrome-observation-report/unique-subject-aerodrome is applied once any xlinks, if used, have been resolved.

//iwxxm:trendForecast should be included with no child elements therein and the value of XML attribute //iwxxm:trendForecast/@nilReason should indicate “inapplicable”.

|===

Notes:

{empty}1. A report with status “CORRECTED” indicates that content has been amended to correct an error identified in an earlier report. The XML element //om:OM_Observation/om:resultTime/gml:TimeInstant is used to reflect the dissemination time of the corrected report.

{empty}2. A report with status “MISSING” indicates that a routine report has not been provided on the anticipated timescales. Such a report does not contain details of any observed or forecast meteorological conditions and is often referred to as a “NIL” report.

{empty}3. The requirements for reporting the use of an automated system are specified in the _Technical Regulations_ (WMO-No. 49), Volume II, Part II, Appendix 3, 4.8.

{empty}4. If XML attribute @automatedStation is absent, then the value “false” is inferred; for example, the meteorological aerodrome observation included within the report has not been generated by an automated system.

{empty}5. Within an XML encoded meteorological aerodrome report, it is likely that only one instance of aixm:AirportHeliport will physically be present; subsequent assertions about the aerodrome may use xlinks to refer to the previously defined aixm:AirportHeliport element in order to keep the XML document size small. As such, validation of requirement http://icao.int/iwxxm/2.1/req/xsd-meteorological-aerodrome-observation-report/unique-subject-aerodrome is applied once any xlinks, if used, have been resolved.

The result of this observation type shall refer to an entity of metatype Record (from ISO 19103). ComplexSamplingMeasurement enforces the following additional constraints: “featureOfInterest” shall refer to an entity of type SF_SpatialSamplingFeature (from ISO 19156), or subclass thereof; and “procedure” shall refer to an entity of type Process (from METCE), or subclass thereof. The OM_ComplexObservation is used because the “result” of this class of observations is a group of measures, provided as a record. Again, this matches the WMO application domain wherein multiple phenomena are measured within a single “observation event”. The term measurement is used in the name in an attempt to reduce confusion arising from the overloading of the term observation.

Category observation

(FM 202-16 onwards)

|OM_CategoryObservation |http://www.opengis.net/def/observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/[http://www.opengis.net/def/ observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/] a|
Observation whose result is a ScopedName (as defined in ISO 19156:2011, clause 7.2.2).

For example: A category observation of the “taxon” (property-type) of “specimen 123” (feature-of-interest) by “Amy Bachrach” (procedure) had the result “Eucalyptus caesia” (from the _Flora of Australia_).

a|
Complex observation

(FM 202-16 onwards)

|OM_ComplexObservation |http://www.opengis.net/def/observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/[http://www.opengis.net/def/ observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/] a|

For example: A complex observation of “major element composition” (property-type) for “specimen h8j” (feature-of-interest) using the “ICPMS” (procedure) had the result “(… array of element proportions …)”.

OM_ComplexObservation is intended for use where the observation event is concerned with the evaluation of multiple properties at a specified location and time instant or duration. The ‘result’ of this class of observations is a group of values, provided as a Record (as defined in ISO 19103:2005 Geographic information – Conceptual schema language).

a|
Count observation

(FM 202-16 onwards)

|OM_CountObservation |http://www.opengis.net/def/observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/[http://www.opengis.net/def/ observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/] a|
Observation whose result is an Integer (as defined in ISO 19156:2011, clause 7.2.2).

For example: A count observation of “the number of votes cast” (property-type) at “the municipal election” (feature-of-interest) using “electronic voting machine tally” (procedure) had the result “3542”.

a|
Discrete coverage observation

(FM 202-16 onwards)

|OM_DiscreteCoverageObservation |http://www.opengis.net/def/observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/[http://www.opengis.net/def/ observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/] a|
Observation whose result is a DiscreteCoverage (as defined in ISO 19156:2011, clause 7.2.2).

Examples include:

{empty}(i) The colour of a scene varies with position. The result of an observation of the property “colour” of the scene is a coverage. Each domain element is a pixel whose index allows the spatial location within the scene to be obtained.

{empty}(ii) Temperature may be sampled using an array of weather stations. The temperature field of the region covered by the array may be represented as a discrete point coverage, whose domain-elements correspond to the station locations.

OM_DiscreteCoverageObservation is intended for use where the observation event is concerned with the evaluation of properties that vary with respect to space and/or time. The ‘result’ of this class of observations is a discrete coverage (as defined in ISO 19123:2005 Geographic information – Schema for coverage geometry and functions).

a|
Geometry observation

(FM 202-16 onwards)

|OM_GeometryObservation |http://www.opengis.net/def/observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/[http://www.opengis.net/def/ observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/] a|
Observation whose result is a geometry (as defined in ISO 19156:2011, clause 7.2.2).

Observation whose result is a scaled number or Measure (as defined in ISO 19156:2011, clause 7.2.2).

For example: A measurement of “mass” (property-type) of “the seventh banana” (feature-of-interest) using “kitchen scales” (procedure) had the result “150g”.

a|
Observation

(FM 202-16 onwards)

|OM_Observation |http://www.opengis.net/def/observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/[http://www.opengis.net/def/ observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/] a|
Observation whose result type is unconstrained (as defined in ISO 19156:2011, clause 7).

An observation is an act that results in the estimation of the value of a feature property, and involves application of a specified procedure, such as a sensor, instrument, algorithm or process chain. The procedure may be applied in situ, remotely, or ex situ with respect to the sampling location. Use of a common model allows observation data using different procedures to be combined unambiguously.

Observation details are also important for data discovery and for data quality estimation. Observation feature types are defined by the properties that support these applications.

a|
Temporal observation

(FM 202-16 onwards)

|OM_TemporalObservation |http://www.opengis.net/def/observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/[http://www.opengis.net/def/ observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/] a|
Observation whose result is a TM_Object (as defined in ISO 19156:2011, clause 7.2.2).

For example: A temporal observation of “duration” (property-type) for “Usain Bolt 100m dash” (feature-of-interest) using “stopwatch” (procedure) had the result “9.6s”.

a|
Truth observation

(FM 202-16 onwards)

|OM_TruthObservation |http://www.opengis.net/def/observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/[http://www.opengis.net/def/ observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/] a|
Observation whose result is a Boolean (as defined in ISO 19156:2011, clause 7.2.2).

For example: A truth observation of “presence” (property-type) of “intruder” (feature-of-interest) using “CCTV” (procedure) had the result “false”.
