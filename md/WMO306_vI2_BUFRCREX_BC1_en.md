Notes:

\(1) Within RA IV, the maximum temperature at 1200 UTC is reported for the previous calendar day (i.e. the ending time of the period is not equal to the nominal time of the report). To construct the required time range, descriptor 0Â 04Â 024 has to be included two times. If the period ends at the nominal time of the report, value of the second 0Â 04Â 024 shall be set to 0.

\(2) Within RA III, the maximum daytime temperature and the minimum night-time temperature is reported (i.e. the ending time of the period may not be equal to the nominal time of the report). To construct the required time range, descriptor 0Â 04Â 024 has to be included two times. If the period ends at the nominal time of the report, value of the second 0Â 04Â 024 shall be set to 0.

\(3) To construct the required time range, descriptor 0Â 04Â 024 has to be included two times.

\(4) Maritime countries may use template TMÂ 307079 (BUFR template for synoptic reports from fixed land stations suitable for SYNOP data and for maritime data from coastal and island stations) instead of template TMÂ 307080 if preferable.

\(5) Template TMÂ 307096 (BUFR template for representation of SYNOP data with supplementary information on one hour observations) may be used instead of template TMÂ 307080 if reporting of synoptic data together with one hour AWS data is required.

**B/C1.2 Surface station identification; time, horizontal and vertical coordinates \<3**Â **01**Â **090\>**

**B/C1.2.1 Fixed station identification**

> WMO block number (0Â 01Â 001) and WMO station number (0Â 01Â 002) shall be always reported as a non-missing value.
>
> Station or site name (0Â 01Â 015) shall be reported as published in *Weather Reporting* (WMO-No. 9), Volume A -- Observing Stations, provided that the station name does not exceed 20 characters. A shortened version of the name shall be reported otherwise.
>
> Type of station (0Â 02Â 001) shall be reported to indicate the type of the station operation (manned, automatic or hybrid).
>
> Note: If a station operates as a manned station for a part of the day and as an automatic station for the rest of the day, code figure 2 (Hybrid) may be used in all reports. It is preferable, however, to use code figure 1 (Manned) in reports produced under the supervision of an observer, and a code figure 0 (Automatic) in reports produced while the station operates in the automatic mode.

**B/C1.2.2 Time of observation**

> Year (0Â 04Â 001), month (0Â 04Â 002), day (0Â 04Â 003), hour (0Â 04Â 004) and minute (0Â 04Â 005) of the actual time of observation shall be reported.
>
> Note: The actual time of observation shall be the time at which the barometer is read. \[12.1.6\]

**B/C1.2.2.1** If the actual time of observation differs by 10 minutes or less from the standard time reported in Section 1, the standard time may be reported instead of the actual time of observation. \[12.2.8\]

**B/C1.2.3 Horizontal and vertical coordinates**

> **Latitude (0**Â **05**Â **001) and longitude** (0Â 06Â 001) of the station shall be reported in degrees with precision in 10^--5^ of a degree.
>
> Height of station ground above mean sea level (0Â 07Â 030) and height of barometer above mean sea level (0Â 07Â 031) shall be reported in metres with precision in tenths of a metre.
>
> Note: The official altitude of the aerodrome (HA in Volume A) shall not be used to report Height of station ground above mean sea level 0Â 07Â 030 in BUFR or CREX messages from aerodromes. Those are two different vertical coordinates. \"Height of station ground above mean sea level\" for each station should be made available to the encoding centre concerned, which may be a centre within the same NMHS or other NMC/RTH.

**B/C1.3 Pressure information \<3Â 02Â 031\>**

**B/C1.3.1 Pressure at the station level**

> Pressure at the station level (0Â 10Â 004), i.e. at the level defined by 0Â 07Â 031 (height of barometer above mean sea level), shall be reported in pascals (with precision in tens of pascals).

**B/C1.3.1.1** The station pressure shall be included in reports for global exchange from land stations, together with either the mean sea level pressure or, in accordance with Regulation B/C1.3.5.1, with the geopotential height of a standard pressure level.

> Note: Inclusion of the station pressure at other times is left to the decision of individual Members.
>
> \[12.2.4\]

**B/C1.3.2 Pressure** **reduced to mean sea level**

> Pressure reduced to mean sea level (0Â 10Â 051) shall be reported in pascals (with precision in tens of pascals).

**B/C1.3.2.1** Whenever air pressure at mean sea level can be computed with reasonable accuracy, this pressure shall be reported.

> Notes:
>
> \(1) For a station situated in a region of normal synoptic network density, the pressure at mean sea level is considered not to be computed with reasonable accuracy when it introduces a deformation into the analysis of the horizontal pressure field, which is purely local and recurring.
>
> \(2) For a station lying in a data-sparse area of the synoptic network, reasonable accuracy will be obtained when using a reduction method, which has proved to be satisfactory in a region of normal network density and under similar geographic conditions.
>
> \[12.2.3.4.1\]

**B/C1.3.3 Three-hour pressure change and characteristic of pressure tendency**

> Amount of pressure change at station level, during the three hours preceding the time of observation (0Â 10Â 061), either positive, zero *or negative*, shall be reported in pascals (with precision in tens of pascals).

**B/C1.3.3.1** Unless specified otherwise by regional decision, pressure tendency shall be included whenever the three-hourly pressure tendency is available. \[12.2.3.5.1\]

**B/C1.3.3.2** The characteristic of pressure tendency (Code table 0Â 10Â 063) over the past three hours shall, whenever possible, be determined on the basis of pressure samples at equi-spaced intervals not exceeding one hour.

> Note: Algorithms for selecting the appropriate code figure are included in the *Guide to Meteorological Instruments and Methods of Observation* (WMO-No. 8).
>
> \[12.2.3.5.2\]

**B/C1.3.3.3** Where it is not possible to apply the algorithms specified in Regulation B/C1.3.3.2 in reports from automatic weather stations, the characteristic of pressure tendency shall be reported as 2 when the tendency is positive, as 7 when the tendency is negative, and as 4 when the atmospheric pressure is the same as three hours before. \[12.2.3.5.3\]

**B/C1.3.4 24-hour pressure change**

> If specified by regional decision, amount of surface pressure change at station level, during 24 hours preceding the time of observation (0Â 10Â 062), either positive, zero or negative, shall be reported in pascals (with precision in tens of pascals). \[12.4.7.1.2(k), (l)\]

**B/C1.3.5 Geopotential height of the standard level**

> Geopotential height of the standard level (0Â 10Â 009) shall be reported in geopotential metres. The standard isobaric level is specified by the preceding entry Pressure (0Â 07Â 004).

**B/C1.3.5.1** By regional decision, a high-level station, which cannot give pressure at mean sea level to a satisfactory degree of accuracy, shall report both the station-level pressure and the geopotential height of an agreed standard isobaric surface. \[12.2.3.4.2\]

**B/C1.4.1.2 Dry-bulb air temperature**

> Dry-bulb air temperature (0Â 12Â 101) shall be reported in kelvin (with precision in hundredths of a kelvin); if produced in CREX, in degrees Celsius (with precision in hundredths of a degree Celsius)
>
> Notes:
>
> \(1) Temperature data shall be reported with precision in hundredths of a degree even if they are measured with the accuracy in tenths of a degree. This requirement is based on the fact that conversion from the Kelvin to the Celsius scale has often resulted into distortion of the data values.
>
> \(2) Temperature t (in degrees Celsius) shall be converted into temperature T (in kelvin) using equation: T = t + 273.15.

**B/C1.4.1.2.1** When the data are not available as a result of a temporary instrument failure, this quality shall be included as a missing value. \[12.2.3.2\]

> Dewpoint temperature (0Â 12Â 103) shall be reported in kelvin (with precision in hundredths of a kelvin); if produced in CREX, in degrees Celsius (with precision in hundredths of a degree Celsius).
>
> Note: Notes 1 and 2 under Regulation B/C1.4.1.2 shall apply.

**B/C1.4.1.3.1** When the data are not available as a result of a temporary instrument failure, this quality shall be included as a missing value. \[12.2.3.3.2\]

> This datum represents the actual height of visibility sensors above ground at the point where the sensors are located. If visibility is estimated by a human observer, average height of observer's eyes above station ground shall be reported.

**B/C1.4.2.2 Horizontal visibility**

> Horizontal visibility (0Â 20Â 001) at surface shall be reported in metres (with precision in tens of metres).

**B/C1.4.2.2.1** When the horizontal visibility is not the same in different directions, the shortest distance shall be given for visibility. \[12.2.1.3.1\]

**B/C1.4.2.2.2** Horizontal visibility greater than 81Â 900 m shall be expressed by 0Â 20Â 001 set to 81Â 900 m; if TDCF data are converted from TAC data, 0Â 20Â 001 set to 81Â 900 m shall indicate horizontal visibility greater than 70Â 000 m.

**B/C1.4.3 Precipitation past 24 hours \<3Â 02Â 034\>**

**B/C1.4.3.2.1** The precipitation over the past 24 hours shall be included (not missing) at least once a day at one appropriate time of the main standard times (0000, 0600, 1200, 1800 UTC). \[12.4.1\]

**B/C1.4.3.2.2** Precipitation, when it can be and has to be reported, shall be reported as\
0.0 kg*Â *m^--2^ if no precipitation were observed during the referenced period. \[12.2.5.4\]

**B/C1.4.3.2.3** Trace shall be reported as "--0.1 kgÂ m^--2^".
