Notes:

\(1) 0Â 01Â 012: Means course made good (average course over the ground) during the three hours preceding the time of observation.

\(2) 0Â 01Â 013: Means speed made good (average speed over the ground) during the three hours preceding the time of observation.

\(3) Within RA IV, the maximum temperature at 1200 UTC is reported for the previous calendar day (i.e. the ending time of the period is not equal to the nominal time of the report). To construct the required time range, descriptor 0Â 04Â 024 has to be included two times. If the period ends at the nominal time of the report, value of the second 0Â 04Â 024 shall be set to 0.

\(4) Within RA III, the maximum daytime temperature and the minimum night-time temperature is reported (i.e. the ending time of the period may not be equal to the nominal time of the report). To construct the required time range, descriptor 0Â 04Â 024 has to be included two times. If the period ends at the nominal time of the report, value of the second 0Â 04Â 024 shall be set to 0.

\(5) If "plain language" text is reported within Section 2, this information can be conveyed in BUFR via the use of an appropriate 2Â 05Â YYY field as an extra descriptor following the above basic template.

\(6) If WMO block and station number is to be included in reports from a fixed sea station, sequence descriptor \<3Â 08Â 009\> may be preceded by sequence descriptor \<3Â 01Â 001\>.

**B/C10.5.2.3** When an ice edge is crossed or sighted between observational hours, it shall be reported as a plain-language addition in the form "ice edge lat. long." (with position in degrees and minutes). This information shall be conveyed in BUFR/CREX via the use of an appropriate 2Â 05Â YYY field as an extra descriptor following the basic template. \[12.3.7.3\]

**B/C10.5.2.4** If the ship is in the open sea reporting an ice edge, the sea-ice concentration (0Â 20Â 034) and ice development (0Â 20Â 037) shall be reported only if the ship is close to the ice (i.e. within 0.5 nautical mile). \[12.3.7.4\]

**B/C10.5.2.5** If the ship is in an open lead more than 1.0 nautical mile wide, sea-ice concentration (0Â 20Â 034) shall be set to 1 and bearing of ice edge (0Â 20Â 038) to 0. If the ship is in fast ice with ice boundary beyond limit of visibility, sea-ice concentration (0Â 20Â 034) shall be set to 1 and bearing of ice edge (0Â 20Â 038) to missing. \[12.3.7.5\]

**B/C10.5.2.6** If no sea ice is visible and the sequence \<0Â 20Â 034, 0Â 20Â 035, 0Â 20Â 036, 0Â 20Â 037, 0Â 20Â 038\> is used to report ice of land origin only, 0Â 20Â 035 shall be used to report the amount of ice of land origin, and 0Â 20Â 034 and 0Â 20Â 036 shall be set to 0, and 0Â 20Â 037 and 0Â 20Â 038 shall be set to missing; e.g. \<0,2,0, missing, missing\> would mean 6--10 icebergs in sight, but no sea ice. \[12.3.7.6\]

**B/C10.5.2.7** In coding concentration or arrangement of sea ice (0Â 20Â 034) that condition shall be reported which is of the most navigational significance. \[12.3.7.7\]

**B/C10.5.2.8** The bearing of the principal ice edge reported shall be to the closest part of that edge. \[12.3.7.8\]

**B/C10.5.2.9** The requirements for sea-ice reporting are covered in the following way by the associated parameters:

> **Sea-ice concentration** -- Code table 0Â 20Â 034
>
> \(a) The purpose of the code figure 0 in code table 0Â 20Â 034 is to establish in relation to code figure 0 in code table 0Â 20Â 036 and code table 0Â 20Â 035 whether the floating ice that is visible is only ice of land origin;
>
> \(b) The possible variation in sea-ice concentration and arrangement within an area of observation are almost infinite. However, the field of reasonably accurate observation from a ship's bridge is limited. For this reason, and also because minor variations are of temporary significance, the choice of concentrations and arrangements has been restricted for reporting purposes to those representing significantly different conditions from a navigational point of view. The code figures 2--9 have been divided into two sections depending on:
>
> \(i) Whether sea-ice concentration within the area of observation is more or less uniform (code figures 2--5); or
>
> \(ii) Whether there are marked contrasts in concentration or arrangement (code figures 6--9).
>
> **Amount and type of ice** -- Code table 0Â 20Â 035
>
> \(a) This code provides a scale of increasing navigational hazard;
>
> \(b) Growlers and bergy bits, being much smaller and lower in the water than icebergs, are more difficult to see either by eye or radar. This is especially so if there is heavy sea running. For this reason, code figures 4 and 5 represent more hazardous conditions than code figures 1 to 3.
>
> **Ice situation** -- Code table 0Â 20Â 036
>
> \(a) The purpose of this parameter is to establish:
>
> \(i) Whether the ship is in pack ice or is viewing floating ice (i.e. sea ice and/or ice of land origin) from the open sea; and
>
> \(ii) A qualitative estimate, dependent on the sea-ice navigation capabilities of the reporting ship, of the penetrability of the sea ice and of the recent trend in conditions;
>
> \(b) The reporting of the conditions represented by code figures 1--9 in Code table 0Â 20Â 036 can be used to help in the interpretation of reports from the two code tables (ice concentration 0Â 20Â 034 and ice development 0Â 20Â 037).
>
> **Ice development** -- Code table 0Â 20Â 037
>
> \(a) This code table represents a series of increasing navigational difficulties for any given concentration; i.e. if the concentration is, for example, 8/10ths, then new ice would hardly have any effect on navigation while predominantly old ice would provide difficult conditions requiring reductions in speed and frequent course alternations;
>
> \(b) The correlation between the stage of development of sea ice and its thickness is explained in the *Guide to Meteorological Instruments and Methods of Observation* (WMO-No. 8).
>
> **Bearing of ice edge** -- 0Â 20Â 038
>
> There is no provision in this code for the reporting of distance from the ice edge. It will be assumed by those receiving the report that the bearing has been given to the closest part of the ice edge. From the reported code figures for ice concentration 0Â 20Â 034 and ice development 0Â 20Â 037, it will be clear whether the ship is in ice or within 0.5 nautical mile of the ice edge. If the ship is in open water and more than 0.5 nautical mile from the ice edge, the ice edge will be assumed to be aligned at right angles to the bearing which is reported.

For example, rain during the entire period shall be reported as code figure 14 for both past weather (1) and past weather (2) in the case of an automatic station incapable of differentiating types of precipitation, or code figure 16 for both past weather (1) and past weather (2) in the case of a station with the higher discrimination capability. \[12.2.6.7.5\]

**B/C10.8.2 Precipitation measurement \<3Â 02Â 040\>**

**B/C10.8.2.1 Height of sensor above marine deck platform**

> Height of sensor above marine deck platform (0Â 07Â 032) for precipitation measurement shall be reported in metres (with precision in hundredths of a metre).
>
> This datum represents the actual height of the rain gauge rim above marine deck platform at the point where the rain gauge is located.

**B/C10.8.2.2 Period of reference for amount precipitation**

> Time period (0Â 04Â 024) for amount of precipitation shall be reported as *a negative value* in hours. It shall be determined:

> \(a) By regional decision (e.g. --6, --12, --24) in the first replication;
>
> \(b) By national decision (e.g. --1, --3) in the second replication.

**B/C10.8.2.3 Total amount of precipitation**

> Total amount of precipitation, which has fallen during the period of reference for amount of precipitation, shall be reported in kilograms per square metre (with precision in tenths of a kilogram per square metre).

**B/C10.8.2.3.1** Precipitation, when it can be and has to be reported, shall be reported as 0.0Â kgÂ m^--2^ if no precipitation were observed during **the** referenced period. \[12.2.5.4\]

**B/C10.8.2.3.2** Trace shall be reported as "--0.1 kgÂ m^--2^".

**B/C10.8.3.2 Periods of reference for extreme temperatures**

> Time period for maximum temperature and time period for minimum temperature (0Â 04Â 024) shall be determined by regional decision and reported as *negative values* in hours. \[12.4.4\]
>
> Notes:
>
> \(1) If the period for maximum temperature or the period for minimum temperature ends at the nominal time of report, the second value of 0Â 04Â 024 shall be reported as 0.
>
> \(2) If the period for maximum temperature or the period for minimum temperature does not end at the nominal time of report, the first value of 0Â 04Â 024 shall indicate the beginning of the period of reference and the second value of 0Â 04Â 024 shall indicate the end of the period of reference. E.g. to report the maximum temperature for the previous calendar day from a station in RA IV, value of the first 0Â 04Â 024 shall be set to --30 and value of the second 0Â 04Â 024 shall be set to --6, provided that the nominal time of the report 12 UTC corresponds to 6 a.m. local time.

**B/C10.8.3.3 Maximum and minimum temperature**

> Maximum and minimum temperature shall be reported in kelvin (with precision in hundredths of a kelvin); if produced in CREX, in degrees Celsius (with precision in hundredths of a degree Celsius).
>
> Note: Notes 1 and 2 under Regulation B/C10.4.1.2 shall apply.

**B/C10.8.4 Ship wind data \<3Â 02Â 059\>**

**B/C10.8.4.1 Height of sensor above marine deck platform and height of sensor above water surface**

> Height of sensor above marine deck platform (0Â 07Â 032) for wind measurement shall be reported in metres (with precision in hundredths of a metre).
>
> This datum represents the actual height of wind sensors above marine deck platform at the point where the sensors are located.
>
> Height of sensor above water surface (0Â 07Â 033) for wind measurement shall be reported in metres (with precision in tenths of a metre).
>
> This datum represents the actual height of wind sensors above marine water surface of sea or lake.

**B/C10.8.4.2 Type of instrumentation for wind measurement** -- Flag table 0Â 02Â 002

> This datum shall be used to specify whether the wind speed was measured by certified instruments (bit No. 1 set to 1) or estimated on the basis of the Beaufort wind scale (bit No. 1 set to 0), and to indicate the original units for wind speed measurement. Bit No. 2 set to 1 indicates that wind speed was originally measured in knots and bit No. 3 set to 1 indicates that wind speed was originally measured in kilometres per hour. Setting both bits No. 2 and No. 3 to 0 indicates that wind speed was originally measured in metres per second.

**B/C10.8.4.3 Wind direction** **and speed**

> The mean direction and speed of the wind over the 10-minute period immediately preceding the observation shall be reported. The time period (0Â 04Â 025) shall be included as --10. However, when the 10-minute period includes a discontinuity in the wind characteristics, only data obtained after the discontinuity shall be used for reporting the mean values, and hence the period (0Â 04Â 025) in these circumstances shall be correspondingly reduced. \[12.2.2.3.1\]
>
> The time period is preceded by a time significance qualifier (0Â 08Â 021) that shall be set to 2 (Time averaged).
>
> The wind direction (0Â 11Â 001) shall be reported in degrees true and the wind speed (0Â 11Â 002) shall be reported in metres per second (with precision in tenths of a metre per second).
>
> Note: Surface wind direction measured at a station within 1Â° of the North Pole or within 1Â° of the South Pole shall be reported in such a way that the azimuth ring shall be aligned with its zero coinciding with the Greenwich 0Â° meridian.

**B/C10.8.4.3.1** In the absence of wind instruments, the wind speed shall be estimated on the basis of the Beaufort wind scale. The Beaufort number obtained by estimation is converted into metres per second by use of the relevant wind speed equivalent column on the Beaufort scale, and this speed is reported for wind speed. \[12.2.2.3.2\]

**B/C10.8.4.3.2** Calm shall be reported by setting wind direction to 0 and wind speed to 0. Variable shall be reported by setting wind direction to 0 and wind speed to a positive *non-missing* value.

**B/C10.8.4.4 Maximum wind gust direction and speed**

> Time period for maximum wind gust direction and speed (0Â 04Â 025) shall be determined by regional or national decision and reported as a negative value in minutes.
>
> Direction of the maximum wind gust (0Â 11Â 043) shall be reported in degrees true and speed of the maximum wind gust (0Â 11Â 041) shall be reported in metres per second (with precision in tenths of a metre per second).

**B/C10.9 "Period" data required by regional or national reporting practices**

> If regional reporting practices in a Region require inclusion of additional "period" parameters, the corresponding "regional" common sequence (see the annex to B/C1) shall be supplemented by relevant descriptors. If national reporting practices require inclusion of additional "period" parameters, the common sequence 3Â 08Â 009 shall be supplemented by relevant descriptors.
>
> Notes:
>
> \(1) "Period" parameter is a parameter that is coupled to a time period descriptor, e.g. 0Â 04Â 024, 0Â 04Â 025.
>
> \(2) No additional "period" parameters are currently required by regional regulations for SHIP data in the *Manual on Codes* (WMO-No. 306), Volume II.
